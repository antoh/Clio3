  Conclusion.</span></CENTER></P>
  <P CLASS="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in"><I>Wherein a Pathetick
  Address is made to all, both Fathers and Mothers, that they will
  admit the preceding Particulars into their Serious and Impartial
  Consideration.</I></P>
  <P CLASS="MsoNormal">&curren; 1. IT only remains, that I wind
  up this Discourse with a Serious Admonition to all those whom
  God hath honoured with the Title of Parents, that they will allow
  it an Impartial Consideration.</P>
  <P CLASS="MsoNormal">&curren; 2. And first I shall speak to <I>all
  Mothers</I>, because they are Primarily and Principally concern&Otilde;d.
  And methinks the very name might supercede the Repetition of
  all other Arguments. For what is the Import of a <I>Mother</I>?
  Why is the Earth stiled the common Mother of all things, but
  that it Nourishes all that it produceth? And do not all other
  Beings the same, whether Animate or Inanimate? Do not Grapes
  hang on the Vine, and Fruits on the Trees that produce them,
  taking their Increase from the Sap of the Wood, to which they
  owe their Original? And among Animals, Doth not the Lamb know
  its own Dam, and run to her Dug among a Thousand in the same
  Flock? Nay even Savage :Lions and Bears stand tamely to be Sucked<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>by their young Cubs. The Philosopher <I>Favorinus</I>
  was then in the right, when he stiled her <I>but half a Mother</I>,
  who Nourishes in her Womb what she knows not, and consequently
  doth not yet love, but casts it off as soon as she knows it,
  and first begins to love it. Nay she is not to be reputed so
  much as half a Mother, since the Nurse doth longer communicate
  Constituent Nourishment to her Child from her Body in Twelve
  Months, than the Mother in Nine. And how, Ladies, would you resent
  it, if your Child should refuse to call you <I>Mother</I>, or
  own any other Woman to be more its Mother than you? If this would
  grieve or vex you, methinks you should be asham&Otilde;d, that
  any other should have done more of the Office of a Mother for
  it than your self.</P>
  <P CLASS="MsoNormal">&curren; 3. Next to your relation to your
  Child, let me <I>remind you of your Religion</I>, which recommends
  the greatest Charity to Strangers and Enemies. And how can it
  be consistent with your Profession of Christianity, which obliges
  you to love your Enemies, to be defective in your Love to your
  nearest Relations? Look then, unkind Mothers, look on your poor
  Infant newly thrust out of your Womb, how Helpless and Forlorn
  it is. Hear the Lamentations wherewith it begins the World. What
  are those cries, but the best ways it hath to implore your Pity,
  solicite your further Care, and to beg of you, now that it is
  excluded from the Womb, to entertain it in your Bosom? Look on
  your own Breasts, which soon after the Birth spring full of Milk.
  Did Nature intend no more in this, but to put you to the trouble
  of drying them? Or did it design you should supply your Babe
  from that Store which she hath provided? It had been much more
  wisely contrived, for you to have been without Breasts and Receptacles
  for Milk, if now you have them replenished, it will be the best
  to deprive your selves of them. It is not then a bold Reflection
  on the Divine Wisdom, to act as if you could have contrived the
  parts of your Bodies better than he hath done? If then you cannot
  be so far forsaken of Reason, as to imagine that the Author of
  your Being intended your Breasts only for needless Excressences,
  much less Snares and Temptations to your selves and others; as
  oft as you look on them remember their proper use; and resolve
  not to suffer your Child to want what Nature hath enabled you
  to supply it with. It is now removed out of your Womb into your
  Arms, and the Meat which Nourished it there, follows it to your
  Breasts, that it may be preserved by the Principles of its Constitution.
  Let not those parts then serve only to minister to Pride and
  Wantonness, which are so apparently intended by God for your
  Infants Sustentation.</P>
  <P CLASS="MsoNormal">&curren; 4. I acknowledge there are but
  very few Persons of Quality that stoop to this Employment; but
  this ought not to discourage you from it, but rather confirm
  your Resolution to undertake it, as it gives you an opportunity
  to shew your selves Singularly good Mothers. Piety is then truly
  Heroick, when it dare own a neglected Duty, and rather be laugh&Otilde;d
  at, then deserve to be reproved. And if Custom were a conclusive
  Argument in all cases, there are very few Vices but might plead
  it as well as this. And your Husbands have as good a Plea for
  the Vices you most dislike (such as Drunkenness, keeping Misses,
  <I>&amp;</I>c.) as you have for hiring other Women to Nurse your
  Children. Those Vices may plead Custom among the Men, as this
  among the Women of Quality. Oppose then this evil Custom among
  Women by your Example, and make the Experiment, whether you can
  hereby teach the Men, as well as your own Sex, to be ashamed
  of wicked Fashions. For who knows how much your Illustrious Example
  may contribute to the overthrowing of Vile Customs, and the restoring
  of Credit to neglected Duties.</P>
  <P CLASS="MsoNormal">&curren; 5. In a word, Let me beseech you
  to consider, how ye can answer to God, your Families, or your
  Country, the Omission of this Duty: If your slighting of Natures
  Dictates occasion any of the forementioned Mischiefs to the best
  Families and greatest Hopes of the Nation; for such we may reckon
  the Children of our Nobility and Gentry to be.</P>
  <P CLASS="MsoNormal">&curren; 6. Especially, Let me intreat you
  once more to consider, How many Children this Custom Murders
  every Year, and what <I>an Hue and Cry</I> of Innocents Blood
  there is against it, which may well overtake the Abetters of
  it with Divine Vengeance,. Murder is an Horrid Crime, but Parricide
  is worse. We detest the Wickedness and Cruelty of a poor Wretch,
  who to hide her Shame strangles her Bastard. And how much better
  are those Mothers, who without so great a Temptation (only to
  gratifie their Luxury or Ease) resign up their Children, the
  hopes of their Family and the Nation, to the Slaughter? If there
  were as much Natural Affection among <I>our Nicer Dames</I>,
  as once there was in the <I>Mothers of Bethlehem</I>, there would
  be as many <I>Rachels</I> among them Weeping for the Slaughter
  of their Innocent Babes. Especially since not a Cruel <I>Herod</I>
  is the <I>Tyrant</I> and <I>Assassinate</I>, but themselves.
  Nor is this any Vain, much less Uncharitable Supposition, since
  it is obvious to common Observation, that though those Mothers
  who do not Nurse, generally bring forth more Children, yet fewer
  of them arrive to Maturity and survive them; which cannot be
  imputed so much to the Frequency of Production (since they are
  usually brought forth as strong and lively as others) as to the
  ill Nursing of them by Strangers. And if we justly detest their
  Inhumane Idolatry, who offered up their Children in the Fiery
  Embraces of <I>Moloch</I> (since it is no more excusable to make
  such Sacrifices to Luxury than to Superstition) methinks it should
  be a very Melancholly Consideration to all Mothers, that the
  Lives of many Thousand poor Innocents, even in this one Nation,
  are Sacrificed every Year for the Support of this Luxurious and
  Unnatural Custom.</P>
  <P CLASS="MsoNormal">&curren; 7. But I must confess there is
  one Case very necessary to be considered, which hath not yet
  been mentioned, viz. <I>That very oft the Father is unwilling
  that his Wife should undertake this Office</I>. And if he will
  not consent to her Nursing, how can she do the Duty of a Wife,
  unless she wave this Office of a Mother? In answer to this I
  have this only to return, That all I have hitherto aimed at in
  this Discourse, is to persuade Mothers to be willing to Nurse
  their Children: If this be effected, all I have to add is, That
  if any Husband be Obstinate in refusing to permit it, the Wifes
  Duty is, to be obedient to him, and leave him to answer for the
  Neglect, which she cannot help. But that this may not hereafter
  be anyones Case, I shall put an end to this Tract,</P>
  <P CLASS="MsoNormal">&curren; 8.<I> Secondly</I>, By an earnest
  Address <I>to all Fathers</I>, that they do not put their Wives
  upon such an Unhappy Strait by their Perverse Obstinacy, but
  rather (as becomes their Duty) encourage them to undertake and
  assist them all they can in performing this Office. You have,
  Sirs, an equal Concern with your Wives in all the precedent Arguments.
  If the Word of God and the Law of Nature oblige them to Nurse,
  it obliges you to teach them their Duty, or at least to encourage
  them to practise it, and not hinder them from it. And whatever
  Mischiefs redound to your Family, or your Child, by drawing the
  Breast of a Stranger, they equally concern you as her, and (unless
  you have put off Reason, together with Humanity and Natural Affection)
  must produce in you a very Sensible Resentment. So that you are
  as much obliged to prevent them as she, and all the Guilt is
  justly to be laid at your door, if it happen through your means
  that she doth not. Most of the Pains and Toil of Nursing is hers,
  and if your Rest be sometimes broken, you are very Soft and Luxurious
  indeed, if you grudge to endure much more than that for your
  Childs good. Nay you are very Churlish and Unkind to her, if
  you contribute not all you can to make her Duty as easie as may
  be to her. <I>Abraham</I>&Otilde;s Joy at the Weaning of his
  Son, is an Evidence he was well pleased that <I>Sarah</I> had
  Nursed him. And <I>Elkanah</I>, who before obliged his Wives
  constantly to accompany him to the Tabernacle, readily consents
  to <I>Hannahs</I> stay at home for the Nursing of her Son. No
  sooner doth she move it, but he answers, <I>Do as seemeth thee
  good</I>. And if all Husbands were in this like <I>Abraham</I>
  and <I>Elkanah</I>, the most Wives would be like <I>Sarah</I>
  and <I>Hannah</I>, as ready, I mean, to Nurse as they. It is
  very rare that any Wife refuses this Office, when her Husband
  is desirous she would undertake it; much more when he peruades
  and encourages her, by the Provision of all convenient Helps
  and Assistance for her.</P>
  <P CLASS="MsoNormal">&curren; 9. In a word, A Custom so inveterate
  as this is, will not be so effectually broke, as by a Mutual
  Concurrence of both the Father and the Mother. If the Mother
  be desirous to Nurse, few Fathers will be so Morose and Unnatural
  as to refuse their Consent: Or if the Father be Solicitous that
  the Mother her self should do this Office for his Son, there
  are not many Women so in love with their own Ease, or forgetful
  of their Childrens Advantage, as to decline it. But where both
  desire it, they will be Meet-helps indeed, and afford such mutual
  Encouragement, as will make all the Fatigues of it Easie and
  Delightful. And Delightful, I dare undertake, it will be to both,
  if there be in them the least Spark of Good Nature. There is
  such a Fascination in the Innocent Postures, and Gradual Appearances
  of Reason, the pretty Smile and confused Jargon, the calm Endearments
  and unfeigned Love of these little Innocents, that the Wisest
  Men have found a Satisfactory Diversion in their Company. And
  if any one questions this, let him forbear to Censure, till he
  have made trial of this Pleasure of a Father: As Agesilaus once
  answered one, who laughed at him for condescending to Play with
  his Son. For I have know some Fathers at first very Averse to
  their Wives Nursing, who after some Experience of those Pleasing
  Diversions, that are to be found in the constant Company of a
  little Babe, would not on any Terms lose the Repetition of that
  Pleasure, by turning the next abroad to a Strange Nurse.</P>
  <P CLASS="MsoNormal">&curren; 10. Thus I have finished my Undertaking,
  and doubt not but I have said enough to demonstrate my Sincere
  Compassion for the Exposed Infants of Great and Honourable Parents;
  enough to vindicate those few Mothers, who by performing this
  Office themselves, have provoked the Scoffs of the rest; and
  enough to discharge mine own Duty in reminding them of theirs,
  according to my slender Ability; which were all the ends I could
  propose to my self, with any Assurance of Success. But if the
  Divine Blessing make these Papers more Successful, it is to direct
  these few small Stones, taken out of a Shepherds Scrip, as to
  Foil a Gigantick Inveterate Custom, and prevail on any, though
  never so few Ladies, to become Nurses, I shall hope for a compleat
  Victory from <I>their Example</I>, which I cannot from my <I>Discourse</I>.
  Let but a few more truly Generous ad Noble Matrons, come in and
  joyn with those few that have already begun to set this Age a
  good Example; and such a bright Constellation cannot but be took
  notice of, and have a vigorous Influence to render it as Fashionable
  for the future, for Ladies to Discharge this their Duty, as it
  is at present to Neglect it.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
