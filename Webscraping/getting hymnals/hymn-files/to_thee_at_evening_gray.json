(68-79).\n\r\nTo Thee at evening gray,\n\r\nTo Thee at growth of day,\n\r\nTo Thee at noon, to Thee at vesper hour,\n\r\nAnd when now fades the light,\n\r\nAnd poured forth is the night,\n\r\n(Both night and day are Thine, and show Thy power),\n\r\nI sing, O Healer of the soul,\n\r\nAnd of the body too: Thou only mak'st it whole.\n\r\n\nII. (10-17).\n\r\n\nAnd wisdom's spring Thou art,\n\r\nAnd dost of it impart;\n\r\nAnd Thou dost drive diseases far away,\n\r\nAnd unto souls dost give\n\r\nUntroubled life to live,\n\r\nWhich earthly care may not stamp down nor sway,\n\r\nWho mother is of pain and woe,\n\r\nAnd all the thousand ills that culminate below.\n\r\n\nIII. (18-27).\n\r\nFrom which O grant to me\n\r\nMy life be ever free!\n\r\nThat I may praise in thankful hymn and song\n\r\nThe hidden Root of all,\n\r\nNor severed be, nor fall\n\r\nFrom God, through ills that to this world belong.\n\r\nTo Thee, O Father Bless&#232;d, I will sing,\n\r\nWho art of this great universe the glorious King.\n\r\n\nIV. (28-37).\n\r\n\nHushed be the world, and still,\n\r\nWhile I my task fulfil,\n\r\nAnd lift to Thee, Supreme, the hymn divine;\n\r\nAnd while my prayers I pour,\n\r\nLet all on earth adore!\n\r\nFor earth, and all her workmanship, is Thine.\n\r\nLet blustering winds their tumults cease,\n\r\nAnd rustling trees and shrill-voiced birds be all at peace.\n\r\n\nV. (38-48).\n\r\nLet ether listener be\n\r\nTo holy psalmody:\n\r\nLet air be silent too: and rapid streams\n\r\nAdown the earth that pour,\n\r\nAnd waves that lash the shore,\n\r\nLet all be stayed, as it in prayer beseems.\n\r\nAnd demon foes to holy strain,\n\r\nWho haunt recesses dark, and in the tombs remain;\n\r\n\nVI. (49-59)\n\r\n\nFly they--far, far away--\n\r\nWhile I my offerings pay:\n\r\nBut all the good, throughout creation's range,\n\r\nThe happy ones who serve,\n\r\nNor from the precepts swerve\n\r\nOf the Great Parent, now in interchange\n\r\nOf holy thought and mind may they\n\r\nBefriend, and upward these my hymns and prayers convey!\n\r\n\nVII. (60-67).\n\r\nThe One, the only One,\n\r\nThe Father Thou alone,\n\r\nThe One beginning whence all else began;\n\r\nThe Fount whence all founts flow,\n\r\nThe Root whence all roots grow;\n\r\nThe Good whence good in all its channels ran;\n\r\nThe Star that to all stars gave birth;\n\r\nThe World whence sprang all worlds from highest heaven to earth.\n\r\n\nVIII. (68-79).\n\r\n\nThe Form of all forms known:\n\r\nAll beauty is Thine own:\n\r\nThe hidden Seed, the ages' Parent Prop:\n\r\nOf worlds intelligent\n\r\nThe Father, whence forth sent\n\r\nAmbrosial Breath, and floating drop by drop\n\r\nUpon embodied bulk, combines\n\r\nA second world, which in reflected glory shines.\n\r\n\nIX. (80-88).\n\r\nO Bless&#232;d, Thee I praise,\n\r\nOr whether voice I raise,\n\r\nOr solemn silence keep; for to Thine ear\n\r\nNot more the uttered speech\n\r\nThan Mind's still voice doth reach:\n\r\nUnuttered though the word, yet Thou dost hear.\n\r\nWith Thee I praise the First-born One,\n\r\nThe First-sprung Light, Thine own Begotten only Son.\n\r\n\nX. (89-95).\n\r\n\nThou Lord of power and might,\n\r\nLight of the Father light,\n\r\nOf the Ineffable the glorious Word;\n\r\nWith the great Father Thee\n\r\nI hymn in unity;\n\r\nAnd Holy Spirit too in blest accord,\n\r\nWho did Himself divinely spring\n\r\nForth from the Father and through Thee, with Thee I sing.\n\r\n\nXI. (96-109).\n\r\nTrue counsel He unfolds\n\r\nAnd middle rule He holds:\n\r\nBreath holy! Spur of Father, Spur of Son!\n\r\nSelf-Parent, and Self-Kin,\n\r\nSelf-nurtured Root within,\n\r\nThe Uncreated, Unbegotten One.\n\r\nThe Eternal glory is out-poured\n\r\nUpon the Son: through whom forth springs the Spirit Lord.\n\r\n\nXII. (110-124).\n\r\n\nGod and of God is He,\n\r\nMid light in Trinity.\n\r\nThee Trinity and Unity we name;\n\r\nFor Thou art Three, yet One,\n\r\nThe Father, Spirit, Son:\n\r\nThough severed, yet unsevered, One the same.\n\r\nForth went the Son to do Thy will,\n\r\nAnd yet with Thee the Father He remaineth still.\n\r\n\nXIII. (125-135).\n\r\nThy rule to bear He goes,\n\r\nAnd upon worlds bestows,\n\r\nWhence He Himself received, life's happy store.\n\r\nThe Word! to Thee I raise\n\r\nWith the Great Father, praise.\n\r\nThe Mind of the Ineffable, before\n\r\nAll worlds, did Thee beget; and Thou\n\r\nBegotten art the Father's Word, to whom all bow!\n\r\n\nXIV. (136-146).\n\r\n\nThou first from the first Root\n\r\nDidst spring, the glorious Shoot;\n\r\nAnd since Thy birth all things have birth from Thee.\n\r\nThe Eternal One, the Seed\n\r\nOf all things, so decreed,\n\r\nThat Thou, first-sown, the Seed of all shouldst be.\n\r\nFor Thou dost all in all fulfil;\n\r\nAnd 'tis by Thee that nature lived and liveth still;\n\r\n\nXV. (147-159).\n\r\nWhere she is highest seen,\n\r\nWhere in the ranks between,\n\r\nWhere lowest: all good gifts of quickening powers\n\r\nFrom God the Father she\n\r\nDoth taste and hold through Thee.\n\r\nGuided by Thee, this ageless sphere of ours\n\r\nTurns her strong wheels on easy poles,\n\r\nAnd seventh in the dance of stars unwearied rolls.\n\r\n\nXVI. (160-170).\n\r\n\nThe many lights on high\n\r\nOne surface beautify\n\r\nIn Thy great world: for Thou dost so ordain:\n\r\nAnd Thou, God's glorious Son,\n\r\nDidst make the ages run,\n\r\nAnd in unbroken course dost them sustain.\n\r\nAll in this globe Thou dost survey,\n\r\nAnd all in circuit tend; and all Thy laws obey.\n\r\n\nXVII. (171-180).\n\r\nAnd in the depths of sky\n\r\nUnfathomed we descry\n\r\nThy ruling hand and power; for it is there\n\r\nThat Thou the stars dost lead,\n\r\nAnd in Light's pastures feed\n\r\nThe glittering host, with a true Shepherd's care.\n\r\nTo all in heaven, in earth, below,\n\r\nThou dost their tasks assign, and life on all bestow.\n\r\n\nXVIII. (181-192).\n\r\n\nTo gods and mortal kind,\n\r\nWhoe'er have quaffed of mind,\n\r\nBy kindly fate, the intellectual shower,\n\r\nThou Lord and Steward art:\n\r\nAnd soul Thou dost impart\n\r\nTo those whose life hath nought but soul for dower,\n\r\nAnd nature's unrestrained control\n\r\nFor hangs on Thee the growth of even eyeless soul.\n\r\n\nXIX. (193-212).\n\r\nAnd things that lack Thy breath\n\r\nAre yet upheld from death;\n\r\nFor Thou hast linked them to the One Supreme:\n\r\nWhence flows to earth by Thee\n\r\nLife's channel still kept free\n\r\nThrough trackless worlds; and the descending stream\n\r\nOf good doth mould this world of ours\n\r\nTo form of unseen world of highest mental powers.\n\r\n\nXX. (213-226).\n\r\n\nA second sun hath shone\n\r\nThis lower world upon:\n\r\nParent of later light: and bright-eyed lord\n\r\nOf what doth live to-day,\n\r\nTo-morrow to decay,\n\r\nBase matter: he doth yet to us afford\n\r\nAll world-born good, by Thy decree;\n\r\nAnd is, O Thou God-born, type visible of Thee.\n\r\n\nXXI. (227-237).\n\r\nBeyond mind's utmost reach,\n\r\nBeyond all power of speech,\n\r\nIneffable, unknown, O Father dread!\n\r\nThou art of mind the Mind,\n\r\nOf souls the Soul combined,\n\r\nOf natures all Thou art the Fountain-head.\n\r\nBehold! Thy servant bends the knee,\n\r\nAnd down on earth a poor blind suppliant falls to Thee.\n\r\n\nXXII. (238-250).\n\r\n\nBut Thou the light dost give,\n\r\nThe light for mind to live;\n\r\nTo suppliant soul, O Bless'd, pity show:\n\r\nDiseases chase away,\n\r\nAnd cares the soul which slay,\n\r\nAnd shameless earthly dog, and fiendish foe:\n\r\nFar from my soul and from my prayer,\n\r\nFar from my life and deeds, chase every hurtful snare.\n\r\n\nXXIII. (252-259).\n\r\nArmed may my body be\n\r\nAgainst the enemy,\n\r\nAnd armed my spirit, and whate'er is mine;\n\r\nNor may he entrance find\n\r\nWithin my heart or mind.\n\r\nOut be he cast, and out, by help Divine,\n\r\nRemain, and leave me, and take flight,\n\r\nThe worldly fiend, who gives to passions strength and might.\n\r\n\nXXIV. (260-274).\n\r\n\nAnd who obstructs the road\n\r\nWhich upward leads to God;\n\r\nAnd quencheth aspiration's holy flame.\n\r\nBut, O great King, give me,\n\r\nCompanion meet to be,\n\r\nAn angel of Thine own, of holy name,\n\r\nOf holy aid, an angel friend,\n\r\nWho may God-lighted prayer, and all good deeds defend.\n\r\n\nXXV. (275-280).\n\r\nA guardian may he be\n\r\nOf soul and life to me,\n\r\nAnd to my prayer and deeds protection yield;\n\r\nMy body may he save\n\r\nFrom trouble's rushing wave,\n\r\nAnd sickness; and from harm my spirit shield,\n\r\nAnd o'er my soul oblivion pour\n\r\nOf earthly passions which disturbed my peace before.\n\r\n\nXXVI. (281-290).\n\r\n\nSo may I spend my life\n\r\nAll calm and free from strife!\n\r\nSo may my soul, in hymning Thy high praise,\n\r\nMount up with strengthened wing\n\r\nFrom earth, and heavenward spring!\n\r\nSo may I cleanse from worldliness my ways,\n\r\nTill I, set free from earth-bound chain,\n\r\nNo longer subject am to Fate's imperious reign;\n\r\n\nXXVII. (291-299).\n\r\nBut gain those halls above,\n\r\nAnd Thy blest folds of love,\n\r\nWhence forth doth flow the fountain of the soul!\n\r\nBut Thou propitious be,\n\r\nAnd helping hand give me!\n\r\nCall me, O Bless&#232;d! all my ways control!\n\r\nHear Thou Thy humble suppliant's cry,\n\r\nAnd lift my soul from earth to native realms on high!\n\r\n\n","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1876","classifications":null}]
