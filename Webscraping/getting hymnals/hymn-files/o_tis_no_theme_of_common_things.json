'Tis no theme of common things\n\r\nThat wakes my ivory-fastened strings!\n\r\nTo Thee, in solemn Dorian strain,\n\r\nI lift my heart and voice amain,\n\r\nO bless&#232;d, O Immortal One,\n\r\nThe holy Virgin's glorious Son!\n\r\nBut, O great King, save Thou my life\n\r\nFrom cares and woes and worldly strife,\n\r\nThat from calamity all free\n\r\nBoth night and day I may praise Thee.\n\r\nAnd to my mind mayst Thou convey\n\r\nFrom mind's own fount, a clear bright ray.\n\r\n\nUnto my youth mayst Thou impart\n\r\nSoundness of limbs and manly heart:\n\r\nAnd may my deeds reflect Thy light\n\r\nIn honour, truth, and glory bright.\n\r\nAnd on the ripeness of mine age\n\r\nMayst Thou the wisdom of the sage\n\r\nBestow, with health, the blessed mead\n\r\nOf harvest rich from well-sown seed.\n\r\nAnd on that darling son of mine\n\r\nMay Thy preserving mercy shine,\n\r\nWhom, when just passing gate of death,\n\r\nThou didst restore to vital breath.\n\r\nO Lord of life, 'twas Thou didst wrench\n\r\nFrom Death's firm grasp, his prey, and quench\n\r\nMy burning grief in floods of joy;\n\r\nFor Thou didst give me back my boy;\n\r\nAnd tears, O Father, Thou didst dry,\n\r\nIn answer to Thy suppliant's cry!\n\r\nMay son and daughter, much loved pair,\n\r\nThy kind protection ever share,\n\r\nAnd all my house, in happy calm,\n\r\nBe sheltered by Thine hand from harm!\n\r\nAnd, O my Saviour King, bless Thou\n\r\nThe partner of my wedded vow;\n\r\n\nFrom sickness and from sorrow free,\n\r\nFaithful, one-minded, may she be,\n\r\nPreserved by Thee from thought of sin,\n\r\nAll bright without, all pure within!\n\r\nUntouched by roving passions' tide,\n\r\nMy honoured wife, my love, my pride!\n\r\nLoose Thou my soul from baneful chains\n\r\nOf worldly life, its cares and pains,\n\r\nAnd floods of dismal grief and woe,\n\r\nWhich overwhelm this earth below.\n\r\nO! thus prepared may I be found\n\r\nWith holy worshippers around\n\r\nTo lead the choir, and chants to raise\n\r\nTo Thy all-glorious Father's praise;\n\r\nAnd to Thy majesty, great King,\n\r\nLoud hymns again I hope to sing;\n\r\nAgain in voice of praise Thy name\n\r\nTo bless, Thy honours to proclaim;\n\r\nMay be, my harp I shall again\n\r\nTune all-unhurt to highest strain.\n\r\n\n","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1876","classifications":null}]
