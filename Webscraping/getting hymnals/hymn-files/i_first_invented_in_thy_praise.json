[{"title":"Songs and Hymns of the Earliest Greek Christian Poets","hymnalID":"SHEG","number":"7","text":"I first invented in Thy praise,\n\r\nO Bless&#232;d, these new metric lays.\n\r\nImmortal Thou! of virgin mild\n\r\nThe holy ever glorious Child:\n\r\nHope of the world, salvation's stem,\n\r\nO Jesus of Jerusalem!\n\r\nTo Thee I raise the song on high;\n\r\nTo Thee my harp-strings joyful ply.\n\r\nO show me favour, heavenly King!\n\r\nAccept the music which I bring\n\r\nOf holy melodies; for Thou\n\r\nArt He to whom my soul doth bow,\n\r\n\nGod over all, God's mighty Son,\n\r\nThe ever blest Immortal One!\n\r\nThe Eternal Father gave Thee birth;\n\r\nBirth Thou hast given to heaven and earth.\n\r\nAll worlds are Thine; all nature Thine;\n\r\nAnd wisdom infinite, divine.\n\r\nIn heaven, as God, Thy fame is spread;\n\r\nBelow, as mingled with the dead.\n\r\nBut when the bless&#232;d day had shone\n\r\nThat Thou shouldst mortal flesh put on\n\r\nOf virgin mother, then the star,\n\r\nSeen by the magi from afar\n\r\nIn eastern clime, perplexed their mind\n\r\nAnd varied skill; nor could they find\n\r\nOr who, or what, the child might be,\n\r\nOr what the hidden deity;\n\r\nNo answer could their wisdom bring;\n\r\nOr God, or doomed to die, or king.\n\r\n'Tis well! meet be your offerings:\n\r\nBring myrrh for death's last sufferings:\n\r\nBring royal presents of fine gold;\n\r\nAnd gifts of frankincense unfold.\n\r\nMy God! here frankincense behold!\n\r\nMy King! deign to receive the gold!\n\r\n\nAnd O! Thou Saviour born to die,\n\r\nMyrrh, for Thy tomb let me supply!\n\r\nAnd cleans&#232;d was the earth by Thee,\n\r\nAnd cleans&#232;d were the waves of sea;\n\r\nAnd all the paths which upward bear,\n\r\nIn slender element of air;\n\r\nAnd dark recesses underground,\n\r\nIn succour to the dead there bound,\n\r\nBy Thee, great Conqueror, were trod;\n\r\nAnd Hades stood aghast at God.\n\r\nBut O! propitious be, great King!\n\r\nSmile on the tribute which I bring\n\r\nOf tuneful songs and measured lays\n\r\nDesign&#232;d for Thy holy praise.\n\r\n\n","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1876","classifications":"Gender Neutral"}]
