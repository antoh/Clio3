[{"title":"Songs and Hymns of the Earliest Greek Christian Poets","hymnalID":"SHEG","number":"1","text":"Wake, wake, I pray thee, shrill-toned lyre!\n\r\nNo more to fan the Te&#239;an fire,\n\r\nNo more the Lesbian strain to raise,\n\r\nWake, wake to hymn of nobler praise!\n\r\nSound Dorian ode, in other guise,\n\r\nThan once to maid with laughing eyes,\n\r\nOr youth whose form and golden tresses\n\r\nMight woo the wanton air's caresses!\n\r\nA better theme inspires my song,\n\r\nAnd bears my soul far hence along.\n\r\nA Virgin's God-conceiving throes,\n\r\nWisdom's own cure for mortal woes--\n\r\n\nThis bids me now my harp-strings ply,\n\r\nAnd earth's black loves and miseries fly.\n\r\nFor what is strength, or beauty's sway,\n\r\nOr gold, or fame--what doth it weigh--\n\r\nOr royal honours--in the scale?\n\r\nWhat these 'gainst search for God avail?\n\r\nLet this man urge the well-horsed car,\n\r\nThat shoot the true-aimed arrow far;\n\r\nAnother watch o'er golden heap,\n\r\nAnd safe his hoarded treasure keep;\n\r\nTo one be pride of glossy hair\n\r\nFlowing o'er neck in wavelets fair;\n\r\nAnother court the favouring glances\n\r\nOf boys and girls in hymns and dances.\n\r\nNot such for me! But this I pray,\n\r\nUnknown to spend life's quiet day;\n\r\nTo this vain world unmarked, unknown,\n\r\nBut God's truth knowing as my own.\n\r\nWisdom present herself to me!\n\r\nGood guide of youth and age is she,\n\r\nOf wealth good stewardess and queen,\n\r\nAlike in poverty serene;\n\r\nBeyond earth's sorrows smiling gay,\n\r\nTo calm content she points the way.\n\r\n\nThat priceless wisdom first I ask,\n\r\nTo guide and sweeten all life's task,\n\r\nAnd then sufficient humble store\n\r\nTo keep me from my neighbour's door;\n\r\nThat I may ne'er, oppressed with need,\n\r\nHarbour dark thoughts of selfish greed.\n\r\n\nHark! 'tis the sweet cicada's song:\n\r\nHe drinks the dew, and chirps along.\n\r\nAnd, lo! my strings unbidden sound,\n\r\nAnd here and there a voice around!\n\r\nWhat in the world--what melody\n\r\nWill pang divine bring forth to me?\n\r\n\n'Tis so! Self-sprung Beginning He,\n\r\n50Father and Lord of all that be:\n\r\nNot made, not born, on high alone\n\r\nHe hath o'er lofty heaven His throne.\n\r\nThere glory changeless He displays,\n\r\nAnd sceptre there eternal sways;\n\r\nOf unities pure Unity,\n\r\nAnd Sole of sole existence He!\n\r\nHigh ether pure He did combine,\n\r\nAnd quicken into Life Divine.\n\r\n\nHe then, ere yet the ages ran,\n\r\nIn mode ineffable to man, \n\r\nThe Godhead through the Firstborn poured:\n\r\nHence Three, yet One, the Triune Lord.\n\r\n\nAnd now the heavenly fount around\n\r\nBehold, with children's beauty crowned,\n\r\nForth from the centre as they spring,\n\r\nOr round it flow in joyous ring.\n\r\n\nBut stop, rash lyre, thy lofty flight,\n\r\nNor touch things hid from mortal sight!\n\r\nTo men below it is not given\n\r\nTo tell high mystic rites of heaven.\n\r\nThe things beneath do thou reveal;\n\r\nThe things above let silence seal.\n\r\n\nBut Mind now cares for worlds alone,\n\r\nIn which reflected mind is shown:\n\r\nA good beginning this we sing,\n\r\nFor thence man's spirit hath its spring:\n\r\nFor now to matter came there down\n\r\nMind incorruptible, high crown,\n\r\nSevered in each, and fragment small,\n\r\nYet true descent from God of all.\n\r\nThis whole, in every part one-centred,\n\r\nWhole into whole as it hath entered,\n\r\nTakes station at the eternal poles,\n\r\nAnd heaven's resplendent circle rolls.\n\r\nDivided next, to those again,\n\r\nIn given form who yet retain\n\r\nTheir dowry unimpaired of mind,\n\r\nThere are high offices assigned;\n\r\nThe chariot race of stars one guides,\n\r\nOne o'er the angelic choir presides.\n\r\nBut, ah! another, empty, vain,\n\r\nSelf-dragged by down-inclining chain,\n\r\nHath found a form of lower earth,\n\r\nDeep fallen from his heavenly birth:\n\r\nFrom home apostate far he flew,\n\r\nAnd cups of Lethe's darkness drew;\n\r\nOf eyeless soul and murky mind,\n\r\nTo heaven's true joy and glory blind;\n\r\nFain he to joyless earth repaired,\n\r\nA god by mortal things ensnared.\n\r\nAll dark! yet, lo! to mortal eyes\n\r\nA ray of cheering light doth rise!\n\r\nA door of hope is opened high,\n\r\nAnd helping hand is stretched out nigh,\n\r\nTo lift the fallen here on earth\n\r\nBack to the honours of their birth,\n\r\nWhen they, emerging from the strife\n\r\nAnd din and cares of storm-tossed life,\n\r\nTo holy paths have turned indeed,\n\r\nWhich to their Father's palace lead.\n\r\nBlest he who from the entangling mesh\n\r\nOf matter and of greedy flesh\n\r\nHath fled, and on with springing bound\n\r\nThe upward way to God hath found!\n\r\nBlest he who, after fates severe,\n\r\nAnd toils and many a bitter tear,\n\r\nAnd all the crowd of anxious cares\n\r\nWhich earth to all her votaries shares,\n\r\nTo mind's true course at length restored,\n\r\nHath God's own shining depth explored!\n\r\n\nA task it is, to lift above\n\r\nWhole outstretched soul in new-born love\n\r\nYet only make determined start,\n\r\nWith wings of mind and honest heart,\n\r\nAnd nigh to thee will He appear\n\r\nWith stretched-forth hands, thy Father dear.\n\r\nBefore will run a shining light,\n\r\nAnd all thy upward paths make bright:\n\r\nFields of sweet thought thou now shalt tread,\n\r\nPledge of true beauty, for thee spread!\n\r\nCome, O my soul, and drink of this,\n\r\nA fountain flowing with all bliss;\n\r\nAnd to thy Father, lifting prayer,\n\r\nWithout delay, up-mount the air.\n\r\nLeaving to earth the things of earth,\n\r\nIn God assert thy godlike birth;\n\r\nAnd mingling with thy Father, Friend,\n\r\nTaste joys above that never end.\n\r\n\n","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1876","classifications":null}]
