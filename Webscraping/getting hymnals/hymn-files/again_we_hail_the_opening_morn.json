Thou, the world's Original;\n\r\nHail! Thou, the Spring, First Cause of all.\n\r\nAll numbers blending into one,\n\r\nThe Uncreated, God alone!\n\r\nAll hail, all hail, Thou One Divine!\n\r\nAll joy, all happiness be Thine!\n\r\nBend Thou, O bend propitious ear,\n\r\nAnd this my hymn of praises bear,\n\r\nSpeed on true Wisdom's opening day,\n\r\nPour blessings down in rich array:\n\r\nYea, grace-distilling streams pour down,\n\r\nThat I may win contentment's crown\n\r\nIn life's sweet calm; the happy mean\n\r\nGive me, riches and want between.\n\r\nOff from my limbs diseases ward,\n\r\nMy soul from stormy passions guard:\n\r\nLet no dark thoughts my steps attend:\n\r\nMy life from biting cares defend;\n\r\nLest, mind, borne down by earthly ill,\n\r\nTo soar should find nor time nor will.\n\r\nBut grant me with free wing to rise,\n\r\nAnd join the chorus of the skies,\n\r\nAnd there with Thine for ever sing\n\r\nThe glories of my God and King!\n\r\n\n","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1876","classifications":null}]
