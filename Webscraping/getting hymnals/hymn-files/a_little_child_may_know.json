A little child may know\n\r\nOur Father's name of love;\n\r\n'Tis written o'er the earth below\n\r\nAnd on the sky above.\n\r\n\n2. Around me when I look,\n\r\nHis handiwork I see;\n\r\nThis world is like a picture book\n\r\nTo teach His love to me.\n\r\n\n3. The birds that sweetly sing,\n\r\nThe moon that shines by night,\n\r\nWith every tiny living things\n\r\nRejoicing in the light,\n\r\n\n4. And every star above,\n\r\nSet in the deep blue sky,\n\r\nAssure me that our God is love\n\r\nAnd tell me He is nigh.","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1962","classifications":"Gender Neutral"}]
