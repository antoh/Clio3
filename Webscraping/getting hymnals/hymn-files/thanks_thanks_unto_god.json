A Father almighty\n\nKeeps watch round our footsteps wherever we go;\n\nHis mercy is sleepless,&#8212;His wisdom unfailing,&#8212;\n\nHe knoweth each want and regardeth each woe.\n\nWhere now is death&#8217;s terror? he comes as an angel\n\nTo carry the spirit away to its rest;\n\nThe gloom which he weareth is lost in the message\n\nHe brings from the Being who loveth us best.\n\nMay we live ever true to the hopes He hath given,\n\nWhile they shed o&#8217;er our path a still holier light;\n\nEver making us nearer and nearer to heaven,\n\nMore pure our affections, our spirits more bright.\n\n","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1866","classifications":null}]
