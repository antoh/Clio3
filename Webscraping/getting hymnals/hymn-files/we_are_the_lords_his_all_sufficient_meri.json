[{"title":"The New Christian Hymnal","hymnalID":"NCH1929","number":"255","text":"1. We are the Lord's: His all-sufficient merit,\n\r\nSealed on the cross to us this grace accords;\n\r\nWe are the Lord's, and all things shall inherit;\n\r\nWhether we live or die, we are the Lord's.\n\r\n\n2. We are the Lord's; then let us gladly tender\n\r\nOur souls to Him, in deeds, not empty words;\n\r\nLet heart and tongue and life combine to render\n\r\nNo doubtful witness that we are the Lord's.\n\r\n\n3. We are the Lord's: no darkness brooding o'er us\n\r\nCan make us tremble, whilst this star affords\n\r\nA steady light along the path before us--\n\r\nFaith's full assurance that we are the Lord's.\n\r\n\n4. We are the Lord's: no evil can befall us\n\r\nIn the dread hour of life's fast loos'ning cords;\n\r\nNo pangs of death shall even then appall us;\n\r\nDeath we shall vanquish, for we are the Lord's.","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1929","classifications":"Gender Neutral,Non-Archaic"}]
