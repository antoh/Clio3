Praise the Lord, O ye His servants,

Praise the Name of the Lord:

We praise Thee, we hymn Thee, we bless Thee

For Thy great glory.

O Lord the King, the Father of Christ, the Lamb without blemish,

Who taketh away the sin of the world,

To Thee belongeth praise, to Thee belongeth the hymn, to Thee belongeth glory,

The Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

Throughout all ages. Amen.

Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart, O Lord,

According to Thy word, in peace:

For mine eyes have seen Thy salvation,

Which Thou hast prepared before the face of all people,

A light to lighten the Gentiles, and (to be) the glory of Thy people Israel.
