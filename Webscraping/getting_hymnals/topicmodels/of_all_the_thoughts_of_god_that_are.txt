Of all the thoughts of God, that are

Borne in upon our souls afar

Along the Psalmist&#8217;s music deep,

O, tell me if there any is,

For gift or grace, surpassing this,&#8212;

&#8220;He giveth His beloved sleep.&#8221;

O earth, so full of dreary noises!

O men, with wailing in your voices!

O delved gold, the wailers&#8217; heap!

O strife, O curse, that o&#8217;er it fall!

God makes a silence through you all,&#8212;

He giveth His beloved sleep.

His dews drop mutely on the hill,

His cloud above it saileth still,

Though on its slope men toil and reap;

More softly than the dew is shed,

Or cloud is floated overhead,

He giveth His beloved sleep.
