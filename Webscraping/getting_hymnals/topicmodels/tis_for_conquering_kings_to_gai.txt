1 'Tis for conquering kings to gain

Glory o'er their myriads slain;

Jesus, Thy more glorious strife

Hath restored a world to life.


2 So no other Name is given

Unto mortals under heaven

Which can make the dead to rise,

And exalt them to the skies.


3 That which Christ so hardly wrought,

That which He so dearly bought,

That salvation, mortals, say,

Will you madly cast away?


4 Rather gladly for that Name

Bear the cross, endure the shame;

Joyfully for Him to die

Is not death, but victory.


5 Dost Thou, Jesus, condescend

To be called the sinner's Friend?

Ours, then, it shall always be

Thus to make our boast of Thee.


Amen.
