1 Above the clear blue sky,

In heaven's bright abode,

The angel host on high

Sing praises to their God:

Alleluia!

They love to sing

To God their King

Alleluia!


2 But God from children's tongues

On earth receiveth praise;

We then our cheerful songs

In sweet accord will raise:

Alleluia!

We too will sing

To God our King

Alleluia!


3 O bless'd Lord, Thy truth

To all Thy flock impart,

And teach us in our youth

To know Thee as Thou art.

Alleluia!

Then shall we sing

To God our King

Alleluia!


 Oh, may thy holy Word

Spread all the world around!

And all with one accord

Uplift the joyful sound:

Alleluia!

All then shall sing

To God their King

Alleluia!


Amen.
