1 In the morning I will raise

To my God the voice of praise;

With His kind protection blest,

Sweet and deep has been my rest.


2 In the morning I will pray

For His blessing on the day;

What this day shall be my lot,

Light or darkness, know I not.


3 Should it be with clouds o'ercast,

Clouds of sorrow gathering fast,

Thou, who givest light Divine,

Shine within me, Lord, O Shine.


4 Show me, if I tempted be,

How to find all strength in Thee,

And a perfect triumph win

Over every bosom sin.


5 Keep my feet from secret snares,

Keep my eyes, O God, from tears,

Every step Thy grace attend,

And my soul from death defend.


6 Then when fall the shades of night,

All within shall still be light;

Thou wilt peace around diffuse,

Gently as the evening dews.


Amen.
