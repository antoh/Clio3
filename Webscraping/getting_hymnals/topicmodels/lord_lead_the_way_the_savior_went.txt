Lord, lead the way the Saviour went,

By lane and cell obscure,

And let our treasures still be spent,

Like his, upon the poor.

Like him, through scenes of deep distress,

Who bore the world&#8217;s sad weight,

We, in their gloomy loneliness,

Would seek the desolate.

For Thou hast placed us side by side

In this wide world of ill;

And that Thy followers may be tried,

The poor are with us still.

with us still.

Mean are all offerings we can make.

But Thou hast taught us, Lord,

If given for the Saviour's sake,

They lose not their reward.
