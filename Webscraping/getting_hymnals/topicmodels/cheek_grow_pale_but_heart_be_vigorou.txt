Cheek grow pale, but heart be vigorous!

Body fall, but soul have peace!

Welcome, pain! thou searcher rigorous!

Slay me, but my faith increase.

Sin, o&#8217;er sense so softly stealing;

Doubt, that would my strength impair;

Hence at once from life and feeling!&#8212;

Now my cross I gladly bear.

Up, my soul! with clear sedateness

Read heaven&#8217;s law, writ bright and broad,

Up! a sacrifice to greatness,

Truth, and goodness,&#8212;up to God!

Up to labor! from thee shaking

Off the bonds of sloth, be brave!

Give thyself to prayer and waking;

Toil some fainting heart to save!
