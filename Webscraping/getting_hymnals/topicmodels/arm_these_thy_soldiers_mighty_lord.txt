1 Arm these Thy soldiers, mighty Lord,

With shield of faith and Spirit's sword;

Forth to the battle may they go,

And boldly fight against the foe,

With banner of the Cross unfurl'd,

And by it overcome the world;

And so at last receive from Thee

The palm and crown of victory.


2 Come, ever-bless'd Spirit, come,

And make Thy servant's hearts Thy home;

May each a living temple be,

Hallow'd for ever, Lord, to Thee,

Enrich that temple's holy shrine

With seven-fold gifts of grace divine;

With wisdom, light, and knowledge bless,

Strength, counsel, fear, and godliness.


O Trinity in Unity,

One only God, and Persons Three,

In whom, through whom, by whom we live,

To Thee we praise and glory give;

O grant us so to use Thy grace

That we may see Thy glorious face,

And ever with the heavenly host

Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.


Amen.
