1 O how shall I receive Thee,

How meet Thee on Thy way,

Blest hope of every nation,

My soul's Delight and Stay?

O Jesus, Jesus, give me

Now by Thine own pure light,

To know whate'er is pleasing

And welcome in Thy sight.


2 Thy Zion palms is strewing,

And branches fresh and fair;

My heart is praise awaking,

Her anthem shall prepare.

Perpetual thanks and praises

Forth from my heart shall spring;

I to Thy Name the service

Of all my powers will bring.


3 Love caused Thy incarnation,

Love brought Thee down to me;

Thy thirst for my salvation

Procured my liberty:

O Love beyond all telling,

That led Thee to embrace,

In love all love excelling,

Our lost and fallen race.


4 Ye, who with guilty terror

Are trembling, fear no more:

With love and grace the Savior

Shall you to hope restore.

He comes: He comes, who sinners

Shall with the children place.

The children of His Father,

The heirs of life and grace.


Amen.
