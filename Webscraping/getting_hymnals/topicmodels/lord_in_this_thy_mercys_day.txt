1 Lord, in this Thy mercy's day,

Ere the time shall pass away,

On our knees we fall and pray.


2 Holy Jesu, grant us tears,

Fill us with heart-searching fears,

Ere that hour of doom appears.


3 Lord, on us Thy Spirit pour,

Kneeling lowly at Thy door,

Ere it closes evermore.


4 By Thy night of agony,

By Thy supplicating cry,

By Thy willingness to die,


5 By Thy tears of bitter woe

For Jerusalem below,

Let us not Thy love forego.


6 Judge and Saviour of our race,

When we see Thee face to face,

Grant us 'neath Thy wings a place.


7 On Thy love we rest alone,

And that love shall then be known

By the pardoned round Thy throne.

Amen.
