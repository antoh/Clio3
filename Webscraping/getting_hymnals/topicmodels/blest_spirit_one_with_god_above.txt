1. Blest Spirit, one with God above,

Thou source of life and holy love,

O cheer us with thy sacred beams,

Refresh us with thy plenteous streams.


2. O may our lips confess thy name,

Our holy lives thy praise proclaim,

With love divine our hearts inspire,

And fill us with thy holy fire.


3. O holy Father, holy Son,

And Holy Spirit, three in one,

Thy grace devoutly we implore,

Thy name be praised forever more.
