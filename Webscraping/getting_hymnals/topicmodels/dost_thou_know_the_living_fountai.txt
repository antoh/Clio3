Dost thou know the living fountain

Whence the stream of grace doth flow?

Dry the streams from snowcapped mountain,

Yet this stream shall fuller grow.

From the very heart of God

Flows its currents deep and broad,

Unto every land and nation,

Bringing mercy and salvation.


Come unto the living waters!

Cried the prophets, do not shrink!

God invites His sons and daughters:

He that thirsteth come and drink.

With this water God imparts

Health and strength to sin-sick hearts.

Why are ye then hesitating

While the Lord with grace is waiting.


With us is the day appointed,

God has kept His gracious word.

He has come, the Lord&#8217;s annointed;

Men have seen the promised Lord.

Saints of God from every race

Found in Him the fount of grace,

And, with joy that never ceases,

Said: The Fount of Life is Jesus.


Hasten then! Let all assemble

At this fountain pure and strong.

Come, ye souls that fear and tremble,

Come, ye old, and come ye young.

Now the hour of grace is here,

Draw then to its fountain near.

Soon, ah soon! the day is over.

Quickly night the world may cover.
