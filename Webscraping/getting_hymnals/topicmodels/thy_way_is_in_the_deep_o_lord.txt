Thy way is on the deep, O Lord!

E&#8217;en there we&#8217;ll go with Thee;

We&#8217;ll meet the tempest at Thy word,

And walk upon the sea.

Poor tremblers at His rougher wind,

Why do we doubt Him so?

Who gives the storms a path will find

The way our feet shall go.

A moment may His hand seem lost,

Drear moment of delay;&#8212;

We cry, &#8220;Lord, help the tempest-tost!&#8221;

And safe we&#8217;re borne away.

O happy soul, of faith divine!

Thy victory how sure!

The love that kindles joy is thine,

The patience to endure.
