1 Thou Who the night in prayer didst spend,

And then Thy twelve apostles send;

And bidd'st us pray the harvest's Lord

To send forth sowers of Thy word,

Hear, and Thy chosen servants bless

With seven-fold gifts of holiness.


2 Oh, may Thy pastors faithful be,

Not laboring for themselves, but Thee;

Give grace to feed with wholesome food

The sheep and lambs bought by Thy blood;

To tend Thy flock, and thus to prove

How dearly they the Shepherd love!


3 Oh, may Thy people faithful be,

And in Thy pastors honor Thee,

And with them work, and for them pray,

And gladly Thee in them obey;

Receive the prophet of the Lord,

And gain the prophet's own reward!


4 So may we, when our work is done,

Together stand before the throne;

And joyful hearts and voices raise

In one united song of praise,

With all the bright celestial host,

To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.


Amen.
