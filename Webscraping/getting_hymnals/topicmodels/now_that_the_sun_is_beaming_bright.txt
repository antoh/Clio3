Now that the sun is beaming bright,

Implore we, bending low,

That He, the uncreated Light,

May guide us as we go.

No sinful word, nor deed of wrong,

Nor thoughts that idly rove,

But simple truth be on our tongue,

And in our hearts be love.

And while the hours in order flow,

Securely keep, O God,

Our hearts, beleaguered by the foe

That tempts our every road.

And grant that to Thine honor, Lord,

Our daily toil may tend;

That we begin it at Thy word,

And in Thy favor end.
