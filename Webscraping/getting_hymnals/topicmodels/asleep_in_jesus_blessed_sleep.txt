1 Asleep in Jesus! Blessed sleep,

From which none ever wakes to weep;

A calm and undisturbed repose,

Unbroken by the last of foes.


2 Asleep in Jesus! Oh, how sweet,

To be for such a slumber meet,

With holy confidence to sing

That death has lost his venomed sting!


3 Asleep in Jesus! Peaceful rest,

Whose waking is supremely blest;

No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour

That manifests the Savior's pow'r.


4 Asleep in Jesus! Oh, for me

May such a blessed refuge be!

Securely shall my ashes lie,

And wait the summons from on high.


5 Asleep in Jesus! Far from thee

Thy kindred and their graves may be;

But there is still a blessed sleep,

From which none ever wakes to weep..
