1 What star is this, with beams so bright,

more lovely than the noonday light?

'Tis sent to announce a newborn King,

glad tidings of our God to bring.


2 'Tis now fulfilled what God decreed:

From Jacob shall a star proceed;

And lo! the eastern sages stand,

to read in heav'n the Lord's command.


3 While outward signs the star displays,

an inward light the Lord conveys,

and urges them, with force benign,

to seek the Giver of the sign.


4 O while the star of heav'nly grace

invites us, Lord, to seek thy face,

may we no more that grace repel,

or quench that light which shines so well.


5 To God the Father, God the Son,

and Holy Spirit, Thee in one,

may ev'ry tongue and nation raise

an endless song of thankful praise.
