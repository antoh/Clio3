O Lord, and Master of us all,

Whate'er our name or sign,

We own thy sway, we hear thy call,

We test our lives by thing


Thou judgest us; thy purity

Doth all our lusts condemn;

The love that draws us nearer thee

Is hot with wrath to them;


Our thoughts lie open to thy sight;

And naked to thy glance

Our secret sins are in the light

Of thy pure countenance.


Yet weak and blinded though we be,

Thou dost our service own;

We bring our varying gifts to thee,

And thou rejectest none.


To thee our full humanity,

Its joys and pains belong;

The wrong of man to man on thee

Inflicts a deeper wrong.


452

Who hates, hates thee; who loves, becomes

Therein to thee allied:

All sweet accords of hearts and homes

In thee are multiplied.


Apart from thee all gain is loss,

All labour vainly done;

The solemn shadow of the cross

Is better than the sun.


Amen.
