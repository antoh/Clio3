1 The cross, it standeth fast,

Hallelujah, hallelujah!

Defying every blast,

Hallelujah, hallelujah!

The winds of hell have blown,

The world its hate hath shown,

Yet it is not overthrown,

Hallelujah for the cross!


Chorus:

Hallelujah, hallelujah,

Hallelujah for the cross!

Hallelujah, hallelujah,

It shall never suffer loss! 	


2 It is the old cross still,

Hallelujah, hallelujah!

Its triumph let us tell,

Hallelujah, hallelujah!

The grace of God here shone,

Thro' Christ the blessed Son,

Who did for sin atone,

Hallelujah for the cross! (Chorus)


3 'Twas here the debt was paid,

Hallelujah, hallelujah!

Our sins on Jesus laid,

Hallelujah, hallelujah!

So round the cross we sing

Of Christ our offering,

Of Christ our living King,

Hallelujah for the cross!  (Chorus)
