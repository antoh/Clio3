1 How blessed, from the bonds of sin,

And earthly fetters free,

In singleness of heart and aim,

Thy servant, Lord, to be;

The hardest toil to undertake

With joy at Thy command,

The meanest office to receive

With meekness at Thy hand;


2 With willing heart and longing eyes

To watch before Thy gate,

Ready to run the weary race,

To bear the heavy weight;

No voice of thunder to expect,

But follow calm and still;

For love can easily divine

The One Belov'd's will.


3 Thus may I serve Thee, gracious Lord;

Thus ever Thine alone,

My soul and body given to Thee,

The purchase Thou hast won;

Through evil or through good report

Still keeping at Thy side;

And by my life or by my death

Let Christ be magnified.


4 How happily the working days

In this dear service fly,

How rapidly the closing hour,

The time of rest, draws night,

When all the faithful gather home,

A joyful company;

And ever where the Master is

Shall His blest servants be.


Amen.
