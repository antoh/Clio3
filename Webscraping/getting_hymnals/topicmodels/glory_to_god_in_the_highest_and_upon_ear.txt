Glory to God in the highest, and upon earth peace,

Good-will among men:

We praise Thee, we bless Thee, we give thanks to Thee,

We worship Thee, we glorify Thee,

For Thy great glory.

O Lord the King in heaven, God the Father Almighty,

O Lord the only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ,

And Holy Spirit:

O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father,

Who takest away the sins of the world, have mercy upon us:

O Thou who takest away the sins of the world, receive our prayer:

O Thou who sittest at the right hand of the Father, have mercy upon us:

For Thou only art holy, Thou only art the Lord,

Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the Father.

Amen.


Every day will I bless Thee,

And praise Thy Name for ever,

And for ever and ever.

Vouchsafe, O Lord, through this day also

That we may be kept without sin,

Blessed art Thou, O Lord God of our fathers,

And praised and glorified be Thy Name

For ever and ever. Amen.


Blessed art Thou, O Lord: teach me Thy judgments.

Blessed art Thou, O Lord: teach me Thy judgments.

Blessed art Thou, O Lord: teach me Thy judgments.

O Lord, Thou hast been our refuge from generation to generation:

I have said: O Lord, have mercy upon me,

Heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee.


O Lord, to Thee have I fled for refuge: teach me to do Thy will,

For Thou art my God,

For with Thee is the fountain of life.

In Thy light shall we see light:

Extend Thy mercy to them that know Thee.
