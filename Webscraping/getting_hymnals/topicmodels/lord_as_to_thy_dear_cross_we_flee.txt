1 Lord, as to Thy dear cross we flee,

And plead to be forgiven,

So let Thy life our pattern be,

And form our souls for heaven.


2 Help us, through good report and ill,

Our daily cross to bear;

Like Thee, to do our Father's will;

Our brethren's grief to share.


3 Let grace our selfishness expel,

Our earthliness refine;

And kindness in our bosoms dwell,

As free and true as Thine.


4 If joy shall at Thy bidding fly,

And grief's dark day come on,

We, in our turn, would meekly cry,

"Father, Thy will be done."


5 Kept peaceful in the midst of strife,

Forgiving and forgiven

O may we lead the pilgrim's life,

And follow Thee to heaven. by love.


6 Kept peaceful in the midst of strife,

Forgiving and forgiven

O may we lead the pilgrim's life,

And follow Thee to heaven!


Amen.
