1 While o'er the deep Thy servants sail,

Send Thou, O Lord, the prosperous gale;

And on their hearts, where'er they go,

O let Thy heavenly breezes blow.


2 If on the morning's wings they fly,

They will not pass beyond Thine eye:

The wanderer's prayer Thou bend'st to hear,

And faith exults to know Thee near.


3 When tempests rock the groaning bark,

Oh, hide them safe in Jesus' ark!

When in the tempting port they ride

Oh, keep them safe at Jesus' side!


4 If life's wide ocean smile or roar,

Still guide them to the heavenly shore;

And grant their dust in Christ may sleep,

Abroad, at home or in the deep.


Amen.
