Onward speed thy conquering flight,

Angel, onward speed!

Cast abroad thy radiant light,

Bid the shades recede;

Tread the idols in the dust,

Heathen fanes destroy,

Spread the gospel&#8217;s love and trust,

Spread the gospel&#8217;s joy.

Onward speed thy conquering flight,

Angel, onward fly!

Long has been the reign of night,

Bring the morning nigh.

Unto thee earth&#8217;s sufferers lift

Their imploring wail;

Bear them heaven&#8217;s holy gift

Ere their courage fail.

Onward speed thy conquering flight,

Angel, onward speed!

Morning bursts upon our sight,

Lo, the time decreed!

Now the Lord His kingdom takes,

Thrones and empires fall,

And the joyous song awakes,

God is all in all.
