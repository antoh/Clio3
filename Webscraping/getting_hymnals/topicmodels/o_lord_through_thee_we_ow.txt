O Lord! through Thee we own

A new and heavenly birth,

Kindred to spirits round Thy throne,

Though sojourners of earth.

How glorious is the hour,

When first our souls awake,

Through Thy mysterious spirit&#8217;s power,

And of new life partake.

With richer beauty glows

The world, before so fair;

Her holy light religion throws,

Reflected everywhere.

The life which Thou hast given,

O Lord! shall never end;

The grave is but the path to heaven,

And death is now our friend.
