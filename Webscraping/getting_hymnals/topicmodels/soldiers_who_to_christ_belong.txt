1 Soldiers who to Christ belong,

Trust ye in His word, be strong;

For His promises are sure,

His rewards for aye endure.


2 His no crowns that pass away,

His no palm that sees decay,

His the joy that shall not fade,

His the light that knows no shade;


3 His the home for spirits blest,

Where He gives them peaceful rest,

Far above the starry skies,

In the bliss of Paradise.


4 Here on earth ye can but clasp

Things that perish in the grasp;

Lift your hearts, then, to the skies;

God Himself shall be your prize.


5 Praise we now with saints at rest

Father, Son, and Spirit blest;

For His promises are sure,

His rewards shall aye endure.
