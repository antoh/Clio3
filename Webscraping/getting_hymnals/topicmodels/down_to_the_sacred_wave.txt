1 Down to the sacred wave

The Lord of Life was led;

And He who came our sould to save

In Jordan bowed His head.


2 He taught the solemn way;

He fixed the holy rite;

He bade His ransomed ones obey,

And keep the path of light.


3 Blest Saviour, we will tread

In Thy appointed way.

Let glory o'er these scenes be shed,

And smile on us today.
