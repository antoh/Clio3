1. A little child may know

Our Father's name of love;

'Tis written o'er the earth below

And on the sky above.


2. Around me when I look,

His handiwork I see;

This world is like a picture book

To teach His love to me.


3. The birds that sweetly sing,

The moon that shines by night,

With every tiny living things

Rejoicing in the light,


4. And every star above,

Set in the deep blue sky,

Assure me that our God is love

And tell me He is nigh.
