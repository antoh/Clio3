1 Go, labor on! spend and be spent!

Thy joy to do the Father's will;

It is the way the Master went;

Should not the servant tread it still?


2 Go, labor on! 'tis not for naught;

Thine earthly loss is heavenly gain;

Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not;

The Master praises: what are men?


3 Go, labor on! enough, while here,

If He shall praise thee, if He deign

Thy willing heart to mark and cheer;

No toil for Him shall be in vain.


4 Go, labor on, while it is day!

The world's dark night is hastening on:

Speed, speed thy work! cast sloth away!

It is not thus that souls are won.


5 Toil on! faint not! keep watch, and pray!

Be wise the erring soul to win!

Go forth into the world's highway!

Compel the wanderer to come in!


6 Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice!

For toil comes rest, for exile home;

Soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom's voice,

The midnight peal, "Behold, I come!"


Amen.
