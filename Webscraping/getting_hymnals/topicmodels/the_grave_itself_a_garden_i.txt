1 The grave itself a garden is,

Where loveliest flowers abound;

Since Christ, our never-fading life,

Sprang from that holy ground.


2 Oh, give us grace to die to sin,

That we, O Lord, may have

A holy, happy rest in Thee,

A Sabbath in the grave.


3 Thou, Lord, baptized in Thine own blood,

And buried in the grave,

Didst raise Thyself to endless life,

Omnipotent to save.


4 Baptized into Thy death we died,

And buried were with Thee,

That we might live with Thee to God,

And ever blest might be.


5 Lord, through the grave and gate of death

May we, with Thee, arise

To an eternal Easter-Day,

Of glory in the skies.


Amen.
