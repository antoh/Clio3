1 O Christ, our King, Creator, Lord,

Saviour of all who trust Thy word,

To them who seek Thee ever near,

Now to our praises bend Thine ear.


2 In Thy dear cross a grace is found - 

It flows from every streaming wound - 

Whose power our inbred sin controls,

Breaks the firm bond, and frees our souls.


3 Thou didst create the stars of night;

Yet Thou hast veiled in flesh Thy light,

Hast deigned a mortal form to wear,

A mortal's painful lot to bear.


4 When Thou didst hang upon the tree,

The quaking earth acknowledge Thee;

When Thou didst there yield up Thy breath,

The world grew dark as shades of death.


5 Now in the Father's glory high,

Great Conqueror, never more to die,

Us by Thy mighty power defend,

And reign through ages without end.


Amen.
