1 O Jesu, we adore Thee,

Upon the cross, our King:

We bow our hearts before Thee;

Thy gracious Name we sing;

That Name hath brought salvation,

That Name in life our stay,

Our peace, our consolation

When life shall fade away.


2 Yet doth the world disdain Thee,

Still passing by the cross:

Lord, may our hearts retain Thee,

Counting all else but loss.

The grief Thy soul endur'd,

Who can that grief declare?

Thy pains have thus assur'd

That Thou Thy foes wilt spare.


3 Ah, Lord, our sins arraigned Thee,

And nailed Thee to the tree:

Our pride, O Lord, disdained Thee;

Yet deign our hope to be.

O glorious King, we bless Thee,

No longer pass Thee by;

O Jesu, we confess Thee

Our Lord enthroned on high.


Amen.
