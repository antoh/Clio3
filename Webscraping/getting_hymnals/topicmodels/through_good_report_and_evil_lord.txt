1 Through good report and evil, Lord,

Still guided by Thy faithful word,

Our staff, our buckler, and our sword,

We follow Thee.


2 In silence of the lonely night,

In the full glow of day's clear light,

Through life's strange windings, dark or bright,

We follow Thee.


3 Strengthened by Thee we forward go,

'Mid smile or scoff or friend or foe,

Through pain or ease, through joy or woe,

We follow Thee.


4 With enemies on every side,

We lean on Thee, the Crucified;

Forsaking all on earth beside,

We follow Thee.


5 O Master, point Thou out the way,

Nor suffer Thou our steps to stray;

Then in the path that leads to day,

We follow Thee.


6 Whom have we in the heaven above,

Whom on this earth, save Thee, to love?

Still in Thy love we onward move;

We follow Thee.


Amen.
