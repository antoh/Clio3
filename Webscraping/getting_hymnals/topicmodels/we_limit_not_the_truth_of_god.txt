1 We limit not the truth of God

to our poor reach of mind,

to notions of our day and place,

crude, partial, and confined:

no, let a new and better hope

within our hearts be stirred:

the Lord hath yet more light and truth

to break forth from his word.


2 Who dares to bind to one's own sense

the oracles of heaven,

for all the nations, tongues and climes

and all the ages given?

That universe, how much unknown!

The ocean unexplored! 

the Lord hath yet more light and truth

to break forth from his word.


3 O Father, Son, and Spirit, send

us increase from above;

enlarge, expand all living souls

to comprehend your love;

and make us to go on to know

with nobler powers conferred-- 

the Lord hath yet more light and truth

to break forth from his word.
