Ah Jesus, the merit

Of all that Thou hast borne

Maketh me inherit

The crown that hath no thorn!


Ah then, teach me duly

To worship at Thy crossv

Owning inly, truly,

The Love that bore our loss.


To sin, there, oh let me

From henceforth daily die;

Nor in death forget me,

Then grant me life on high.
