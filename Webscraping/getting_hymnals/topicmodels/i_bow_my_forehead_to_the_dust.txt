1 I bow my forehead to the dust,

I veil mine eyes for shame,

And urge, in trembling self-distrust,

A prayer without a claim.


2 No offering of my own I have,

Nor works my faith to prove;

I can but give the gifts He gave,

And plead His love for love.


3 I dimly guess, from blessings known,

Of greater out of sight;

And, with the chastened Psalmist, own

His judgments too are right.


4 And if my heart and flesh are weak

To bear an untried pain,

The bruis'd reed He will not break,

But strengthen and sustain.


5 I know not what the future hath

Of marvel or surprise,

Assured alone that life and death

His mercy underlies.


6 And so beside the silent sea

I wait the muffled oar:

No harm from Him can come to me

On ocean or on shore.


7 I know not where His islands lift

Their fronded palms in air;

I only know I cannot drift

Beyond His love and care.


8 And Thou, O Lord, by whom are seen

Thy creatures as they be,

Forgive me if too close I lean

My human heart on Thee.


Amen.
