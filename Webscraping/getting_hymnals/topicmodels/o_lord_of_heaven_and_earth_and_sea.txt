1 O Lord of heaven, and earth, and sea,

To Thee all praise and glory be;

How shall we show our love to Thee

Who givest all?


2 The golden sunshine, vernal air,

Sweet flowers and fruit Thy love declare,

Where harvests ripen, Thou art there

Who givest all!


3 For peaceful homes, and healthful days,

For all the blessings earth displays,

We owe Thee thankfulness and praise,

Who givest all!


4 Thou didst not spare Thine only Son,

But gav'st Him for a world undone,

And freely with that Bless'd One

Thou givest all.


5 Thou giv'st the Spirit's holy dower,

Spirit of life, and love, and power,

And dost His sevenfold graces shower

Upon us all.


6 For souls redeemed, for sins forgiven,

For means of grace and hopes of heaven,

O Lord, what can to Thee be given

Who givest all?


7 We lose what on ourselves we spend;

We have as treasure without end

Whatever, Lord, to Thee we lend,

Who givest all.


8 Whatever, Lord, we lend to Thee,

Repaid a thousandfold will be;

Then gladly will we give to Thee

Who givest all;


9 To Thee, from Whom we all derive

Our life, our gifts, our power to give;

Oh, may we ever with Thee live

Who givest all!


Amen.
