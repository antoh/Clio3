1 O Love divine, that stooped to share

Our sharpest pang, our bitterest tear!

On Thee we cast each earth-born care;

We smile at pain while Thou art near.


2 Though long the weary way we tread,

And sorrow crown each lingering year,

No path we shun, no darkness dread,

Our hearts still whispering, Thou art near.


3 When drooping pleasure turns to grief,

And trembling faith is changed to fear,

The murmuring wind, the quivering leaf,

Shall softly tell us, Thou art near.


4 On Thee we fling our burdening woe,

O Love divine, forever dear!

Content to suffer, while we know,

Living and dying, Thou art near.


Amen.
