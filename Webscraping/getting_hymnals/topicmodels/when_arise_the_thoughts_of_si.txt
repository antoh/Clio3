When arise the thoughts of sin,

When the world our hearts would win,

When, to selfish pleasure given,

Droops the love that blooms for heaven;

Lord, we would remember thee,&#8212;

Thou wilt our Redeemer be.

When, with footsteps faint and slow,

Duty&#8217;s upward path we go;

When, by toils and hardship pressed,

Round we turn to look for rest;

Lord, we would remember thee,

Thou our Guide and Strength wilt be.

When the way grows dark and drear,

When, beset by doubt and fear,

We can see no beam of light

Struggling through the thickening night;

Lord, we would remember thee,

Thou our Comforter wilt be.
