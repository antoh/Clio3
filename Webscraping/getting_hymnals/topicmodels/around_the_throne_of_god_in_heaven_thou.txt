1 Around the throne of God in heaven

Thousands of children stand,

Children whose sins are all forgiven,

A holy, happy band,

Singing, "Glory, glory,

Glory be to God on high."


2 In flowing robes of spotless white

See every one arrayed;

Dwelling in everlasting light

And joys that never fade, 

Singing, "Glory, glory,

Glory be to God on high."


3 What brought them to that world above,

That heaven so bright and fair,

Where all is peace, and joy, and love;

How came those children there, 

Singing, "Glory, glory,

Glory be to God on high?"


4 Because the Saviour shed His blood

To wash away their sin;

Bathed in that pure and precious flood,

Behold them white and clean, 

Singing, "Glory, glory,

Glory be to God on high."


5 On earth they sought the Saviour's grace,

On earth they loved His Name;

So now they see His blessed face,

And stand before the Lamb, 

Singing, "Glory, glory,

Glory be to God on high."


Amen.
