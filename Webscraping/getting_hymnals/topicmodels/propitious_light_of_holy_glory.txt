Propitious Light of holy glory,

Of the immortal Heavenly Father,

Holy, blessed,

O Jesu Christ,

Having come to the setting of the sun,

Having seen the evening light,

We hymn the Father, the Son,

And the Holy Spirit, God.

Thou art worthy at all seasons

To be hymned with thankful voices,

O Son of God, who givest life;

Wherefore the world glorifieth Thee.
