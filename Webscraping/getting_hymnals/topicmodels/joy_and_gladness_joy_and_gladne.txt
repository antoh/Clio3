1 Joy and gladness! Joy and gladness!

O happy day!

Ev'ry thought of sin and sadness

chase, chase away.

Heard ye not the angels telling,

Christ the Lord of might excelling

on the earth with us is dwelling,

clad in our clay?


2 Son of Mary (blessed mother),

thy love we claim;

Son of God, our elder brother

(O gentle name!)

to thy Father's throne ascended,

with thine own his glory blended,

thou art, all thy trials ended,

ever the same.


3 In thy holy footsteps treading,

guide, lest we stray;

from thy word of promise shedding

light on our way,

never leave us nor forsake us;

like thyself in mercy make us,

and at last to glory take us,

Jesus, we pray.
