1 Where the angel-hosts adore Thee,

Thou, O God, in heaven dost reign;

At Thy word they rose around Thee,

And Thy word dost them sustain.


2 Thousand times ten thousand, bending

At Thy throne, their homage pay;

Flames of fire in strength excelling,

Swift Thy pleasure to obey.


3 Fashioned in a wondrous order,

Thee they serve, their Lord and King;

Grant that in our cares and dangers

They may timely succor bring.


4 Praise to Thee Who hast created

Earth and heaven with all their host;

Praise to Thee, O God most mighty,

Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.


Amen.
