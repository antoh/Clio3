1 O God, in Whose all-searching eye

Thy servants stand, to ratify

The vow baptismal, by them made,

When first Thy hand was on them laid;

Bless them, O Holy Father, bless,

Who Thee, with heart and voice confess;

May they, acknowledged as Thine own,

Stand evermore before Thy throne.


2 O Christ, Who didst at Pentecost

Send down from heaven the Holy Ghost;

And at Samaria baptize

Those whom Thou didst evangelize;

And then on Thy baptized confer

The best of gifts, the Comforter,

By apostolic hands, and prayer;

Be with us now, as Thou wert there.


3 Arm these Thy soldiers, mighty Lord,

With shield of faith, and Spirit's sword;

Forth to the battle may they go,

And boldly fight against the foe,

With banner of the cross unfurled,

And by it overcome the world;

And so at last receive from Thee

The palm and crown of victory.


4 Come, ever bless'd Spirit, come,

And make Thy servant's hearts Thy home;

Thus consecrated, Lord, to Thee,

May each a living temple be.

Enrich that temple's holy shrine

With sevenfold gifts of grace divine;

With wisdom, light, and knowledge, bless,

Strength, counsel, fear, and godliness.


Amen.
