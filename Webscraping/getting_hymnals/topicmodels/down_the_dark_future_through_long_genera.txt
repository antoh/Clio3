Down the dark future, through long generations,

The sounds of war grow fainter and then cease;

And, like a bell with solemn, sweet vibrations,

I hear once more the voice of Christ say, &#8220;Peace!&#8221;

Peace! and no longer, from its brazen portals,

The blast of war&#8217;s great organ shakes the skies;

But beautiful as songs of the immortals,

The holy melodies of love arise.
