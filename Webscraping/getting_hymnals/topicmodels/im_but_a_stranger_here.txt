1 I'm but a stranger here,

Heaven is my home;

Earth is a desert drear;

Heaven is my home.

Danger and sorrow stand

Round me on every hand,

Heaven is my fatherland,

Heaven is my home.


2 What though the tempest rage,

Heaven is my home;

Short is my pilgrimage,

Heaven is my home.

And time's wild wintry blast

Soon shall be over-past;

I shall reach home at last,

Heaven is my home.


3 Therefore I murmur not,

Heaven is my home;

Whate'er my earthly lot,

Heaven is my home.

And I shall surely stand

There at my Lord's right hand;

Heaven is my fatherland,

Heaven is my home.


Amen.4 Therefore I murmur not,

Heaven is my home;

Whate'er my earthly lot,

Heaven is my home:

And I shall surely stand

There at my Lord's right hand:

Heaven is my fatherland,

Heaven is my home.


Amen.
