1 Christ is our corner-stone,

On Him alone we build;

With His true saints above

The courts of heaven are filled,

On His great love our hopes we place

Of present grace and joys above.


2 O then with hymns of praise

These hallowed courts shall ring;

Our voices we will raise

The Three in One to sing;

And thus proclaim in joyful song,

Both loud and long that glorious Name.


3 Here, gracious God, do Thou

For evermore draw nigh;

Accept each faithful vow,

And mark each suppliant sigh;

In copious shower on all who pray,

Each holy day, Thy blessings pour.


4 Here may we gain from heaven

The grace which we implore;

And may that grace, once given,

Be with us evermore,

Until that day when all the blest

To endless rest are called away.way.


Amen.
