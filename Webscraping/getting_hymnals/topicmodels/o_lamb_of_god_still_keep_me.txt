1 O Lamb of God, still keep me

Near to Thy wound'd side!

'Tis only there in safety

And peace I can abide.

What foes and snares surround me!

What doubts and fears within!

The grace that sought and found me

Alone can keep me clean.


2 'Tis only in Thee hiding,

I know my life secure;

Only in Thee abiding,

The conflict can endure:

Thine arm the victory gaineth

O'er every hateful foe;

Thy love my heart sustaineth

In all its care and woe.


3 Soon shall my eyes behold Thee,

With rapture, face to face;

One half hath not been told me

Of all Thy power and grace:

Thy beauty, Lord, and glory,

The wonders of Thy love,

Shall be the endless story

Of all Thy saints above.


Amen.
