1 There many shall come from the east and the west

And sit at the feast of salvation

With Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the blest,

Obeying the Lord's invitation.

Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!


2 But they wo have always resisted His grace

And on their own virtue depended,

Shall then be condemned and cast out from His face,

Eternally lost and unfriended.

Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!


3 O may we all hear when our Shepherd doth call,

In accents persuasive and tender,

That while there is time we make haste one and all

And find Him, our mighty Defender.

Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!


4 O that we the throng of the ransomed may swell,

To whom He hath granted remission.

God graciously make us in heaven to dwell

And save us from endless perdition.

Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!


5 God grant that I may of His infinite love

Remain in His merciful keeping;

And sit withg the King at His table above,

When here in the grace I am sleeping.

Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!


6 All trials are then like a dream that is past,

Forgotten all trouble and sorrow;

All questions and doubts have been answered at last;

Then dawneth eternity's morrow.

Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!


7 The heavens shall ring with an anthem more grand

Than ever on earth was recorded;

The blest of the Lord shall receive at His hand

The crown to the victors awarded.

Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!
