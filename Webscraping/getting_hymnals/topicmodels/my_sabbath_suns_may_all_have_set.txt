1 As now the sun's declining rays

Towards the eve descend,

E'en so our years are sinking down

To their appointed end.


2 Lord, on the Cross Thine arms were stretch'd,

To draw Thy people nigh;

O grant us then that Cross to love,

And in those arms to die.


3 To God the Father, God the Son,

And God the Holy Ghost,

All glory be from saints on earth,

And from the angel host.


Amen.
