1 Jesus, Sun and Shield art Thou;

Sun and Shield for ever:

Never canst Thou cease to shine,

Cease to guard us never.

Cheer our steps as on we go,

Come between us and the foe.


2 Jesus, Bread and Wine art Thou,

Wine and Bread for ever:

Never canst Thou cease to feed,

Or refresh us never.

Feed we still on Bread Divine,

Drink we still this heavenly Wine.


3 Jesus, Love and Life art Thou,

Life and Love for ever:

Ne'er to quicken shalt Thou cease,

Or to love us never.

All of life or love we need

Is in Thee, in Thee indeed.


4 Jesus, Peace and Joy art Thou,

Joy and Peace for ever:

Joy that fades not, changes not,

Peace that leaves us never.

Joy and peace we have in Thee,

Now and through eternity.


5 Jesus, Song and Strength art Thou,

Strength and Song for ever:

Strength that never can decay,

Song that ceaseth never.

Still to us this strength and song

Through eternal days prolong.


Amen.
