O God! who knowest how frail we are,

How soon the thought of good departs;

We pray that Thou wouldst feed the fount

Of holy yearning in our hearts.

Let not the choking cares of earth

The precious springs of life o&#8217;ergrow;

But, ever guarded by Thy love,

Still purer may their waters flow.

To Thee, with sweeter hope and trust,

Be every day our spirits given;

And may we, while we walk on earth,

Walk more as citizens of heaven.
