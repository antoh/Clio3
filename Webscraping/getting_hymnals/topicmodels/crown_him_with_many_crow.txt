1 Crown Him with many crowns,

The Lamb upon His throne;

Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns

All music but its own!

Awake, my soul, and sing

Of Him Who died for thee;

And hail Him as thy matchless King

Through all eternity.


2 Crown Him the Virgin's Son!

The God incarnate born,

Whose arm those crimson trophies won

Which now His brow adorn,

Fruit of the Mystic Rose,

True Branch of Jesse's stem,

The Root whence mercy ever flows,

The Babe of Bethlehem!


3 Crown Him the Lord of Love!

Behold His hands and side,--

Those wounds, yet visible above,

In beauty glorified:

No angel in the sky

Can fully bear that sight,

But downward bends his wondering eye

At mysteries so bright.


4 Crown Him the Lord of Peace!

whose power a sceptre sways

In heaven and earth, that wars may cease,

And all be prayer and praise.

His reign shall know no end;

And round His pierc'd feet

Fair flowers of Paradise extend

Their fragrance ever sweet.


5 Crown Him the Lord of Heaven!

One with the Father known,--

And the blest Spirit, through Him given

From yonder Triune throne!

All hail, Redeemer, hail!

For Thou hast died for me:

thy praise and glory shall not fail

Throughout eternity.

For He is King of all.


Amen.
