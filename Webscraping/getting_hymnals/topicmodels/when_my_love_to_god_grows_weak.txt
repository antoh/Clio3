When my love to Christ grows weak,

When for deeper faith I seek,

Then in thought I go to thee,

Garden of Gethsemane!

There I walk amid the shades,

While the lingering twilight fades,

See that suffering, friendless One

Weeping, praying there alone.

When my love for Christ grows weak,

When for stronger faith I seek,

Hill of Calvary! I go

To thy scenes of fear and woe;&#8212;

There behold his agony,

Suffered on the bitter tree;

See his anguish, see his faith;

Love triumphant still in death.

Then to life I turn again,

Learning all the worth of pain,

Learning all the might that lies

In a full self-sacrifice.
