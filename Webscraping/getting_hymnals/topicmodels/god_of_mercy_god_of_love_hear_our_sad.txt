God of mercy! God of love!

Hear our sad, repentant songs;

Listen to Thy suppliant ones,

Thou, to whom all grace belongs!

Deep regret for follies past,

Talents wasted, time misspent;

Hearts debased by worldly cares,

Thankless for the blessings lent;&#8212;

Foolish fears and fond desires,

Vain regrets for things as vain;

Lips too seldom taught to praise,

Oft to murmur and complain;&#8212;

These, and every secret fault,

Filled with grief and shame, we own;

Humbled at Thy feet we bow,

Seeking strength from Thee alone.

God of mercy! God of love!

Hear our sad, repentant songs;

O, restore Thy suppliant ones,

Thou to whom all grace belongs!
