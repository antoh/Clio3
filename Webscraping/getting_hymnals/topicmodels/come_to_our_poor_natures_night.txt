1 Come to our poor nature's night

With Thy bless'd inward light,

Holy Ghost, the infinite,

Comforter divine.


2 We are sinful, cleanse us, Lord;

Sick and faint, Thy strength afford;

Lost, until by Thee restored;

Comforter divine.


3 Orphan are our souls and poor;

Give us from Thy heavenly store

Faith, love, joy for evermore,

Comforter divine.


4 Like the dew our peace distil;

Guide, subdue our wayward will,

Things of Christ unfolding still,

Comforter divine.


5 Gentle, awful, holy Guest,

Make Thy temple in each breast;

There Thy presence by confest,

Comforter divine.


6 With us, for us, intercede,

And with voiceless groanings plead

Our unutterable need,

Comforter divine.


7 In us, "Abba, Father," cry;

Earnest of the bliss on high,

Seal of immortality,

Comforter divine.


8 Search for us the depths of God;

Upwards, by the starry road,

Bear us to Thy high abode,

Comforter divine.


Amen.
