1929
1. O day of rest and gladness,

O day of joy and light,

O balm of care and sadness,

Most beautiful, most bright;

On thee, the high and lowly,

Bending before the throne,

Sing, Holy, Holy, Holy,

To the great Three in One.


2. On thee, at the creation,

The light first had its birth;

On thee, for our salvation,

Christ rose from depths of earth.

On thee, our Lord victorious

The Spirit sent from Heav'n;

And thus on thee most glorious

A triple light was given.


3. Today on weary nations

The heav'nly manna falls;

To holy convocations

The silver trumpet calls,

Where gospel light is glowing

With pure and radiant beams,

And living water flowing

With soul-refreshing streams.


4. New graces ever gaining

From this our day of rest,

We reach the rest remaining

To spirits of the blest.

To Holy Ghost be praises,

To Father and to Son;

The Church her voice upraises

To Thee, blest Three in One.

Amen.
