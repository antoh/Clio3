Asleep in Jesus! blessed sleep!

From which none ever wakes to weep;

A calm and undisturbed repose,

Unbroken by the last of foes.

Asleep in Jesus! O how sweet

To be for such a slumber meet;

With holy confidence to sing

That death hath lost its painful sting!


Asleep in Jesus! peaceful rest!

Whose waking is supremely blest;

No fear, no woe shall dim that hour

That manifests the Savior's power.


Asleep in Jesus! O for me

May such a blissful refuge be!

Securely shall my ashes lie,

Waiting the summons from on high.


Asleep in Jesus! far from thee

Thy kindred and their graves may be;

But there is still a blessed sleep,

From which none ever wakes to weep.
