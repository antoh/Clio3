A few more years shall roll,

A few more seasons come,

And we shall be with those that rest

Asleep within the tomb:

Then, O my Lord, prepare

My soul for that great day;

O wash me in thy precious blood,

And take my sins away.

A few more storms shall beat

On this wild rocky shore,

And we shall be where tempests cease,

And surges swell no more:

Then, O my Lord, prepare

My soul for that calm day;

A few more sabbaths here

Shall cheer us on our way,

And we shall reach the endless rest,

Th'eternal sabbath day:

Then, O my Lord, prepare

My soul for that sweet day;

'Tis but a little while,

And he shall come again

Who died that we might live, who lives

That we with him may reign:

Then, O my Lord, prepare

My soul for that glad day;
