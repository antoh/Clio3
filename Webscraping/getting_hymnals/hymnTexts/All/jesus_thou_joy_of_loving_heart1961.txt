For ever settled in the heavens

Thy Word, O Lord, shall firmly stand;

Thy faithfulness shall never fail;

The earth abides at thy command.

Thy word and works unmoved remain,

Thine every purpose to fulfil;

All things are thine and thee obey,

And all as servants wait thy will.

I should have perished in my woe

Had not I loved thy law divine;

That law I never can forget;

O save me, Lord, for I am thine.

The wicked would destroy my soul,

But in thy truth is refuge sure;

Exceeding broad is thy command,

And in perfection shall endure.
