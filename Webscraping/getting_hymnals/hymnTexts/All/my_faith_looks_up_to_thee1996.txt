1 My faith looks up to thee, 

thou Lamb of Calvary, 

Saviour divine.

Now hear me while I pray;

take all my guilt away.

O let me from this day 

be wholly thine.


2 While life's dark maze I tread,

and griefs around me spread, 

be thou my guide,

bid darkness turn to day; 

wipe sorrow's tears away;

nor let me ever stray 

from thee aside. 


3 May thy rich grace impart 

strength to my fainting heart, 

my zeal inspire.

As thou hast died for me, 

O may my love to thee 

pure, warm, and changeless be, 

a living fire.
aside. 


4 When ends life's transient dream, 

When death's cold, sullen stream 

Shall o'er me roll, 

Blest Savior, then, in love, 

Fear and distrust remove; 

Oh, bear me safe above, 

A ransomed soul!
