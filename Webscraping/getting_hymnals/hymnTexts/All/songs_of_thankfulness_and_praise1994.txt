1 Songs of thankfulness and praise, 

Jesus, Lord, to you we raise, 

Manifested by the star 

To the sages from afar; 

Branch of royal David's stem 

In your birth at Bethlehem; 

Anthems be to you addrest,

God in flesh made manifest.


2 Manifest at Jordan's stream, 

Prophet, Priest, and King supreme; 

And at Cana, wedding guest, 

in your Godhead manifest;

Manifest in pow'r divine, 

Changing water into wine;  

Anthems be to you addrest,

God in flesh made manifest.


3 Manifest in making whole 

Palsied limbs and fainting soul; 

Manifest in valiant fight, 

Quelling all the devil's might; 

Manifest in gracious will, 

Ever bringing good from ill; 

Anthems be to you addrest,

God in flesh made manifest.


4 Grant us grace to see you, Lord,

Mirrored in your holy word;

May we imitate you now,

And on us your grace endow;

That we like to you may be

At your great epiphany;

And may praise you ever blest,

God is flesh made manifest.
