Lord of heaven and earth and sea,

To thee all praise and glory be;

How shall we show our love to thee

Who givest all?


The golden sunshine, vernal air,

Sweet flowers and fruit, thy love declare;

Where harvests ripen, thou art there

Who givest all.


For peaceful homes and healthful days,

For all the blessings earth displays,

We owe thee thankfulness and praise

Who givest all.


Thou didst not spare thine only Son,

But gav'st him for a world undone,

And freely with that Bless'd One

Thou givest all.


Thou giv'st the Holy Spirit's dower,

Spirit of life, and love and power,

And dost his sevenfold graces shower

Upon us all.

For souls redeemed, for sins forgiven,

For means of grace and hopes of heaven,

Father, what can to thee be given

Who givest all?


To thee, from whom we all derive

Our life, our gifts, our power to give;

O may we ever with thee live

Who givest all.


Amen.
