1. O Jesus, we adore Thee,

Upon the cross, our King!

We bow our hearts before Thee,

Thy gracious Name we sing.

That Name hath brought salvation,

That Name in life our stay,

Our peace, our consolation,

When life shll fade away.


2. Yet doth the world disdain Thee,

Still passing by the cross:

Lord, may our hearts retain Thee;

All else we count but loss.

Ah, Lord, our sins arraigned Thee,

And nailed Thee to the tree;

Our pride, O Lord, disdained Thee;

Yet deign our hope to be.


3. O glorious King, we bless Thee,

No longer pass Thee by;

O j=Jesus, we confess Thee

The Son enthroned on high.

Lord, grant to us remission;

Life through Thy death restore;

Yea, grant us the fruition

Of life forevermore.
