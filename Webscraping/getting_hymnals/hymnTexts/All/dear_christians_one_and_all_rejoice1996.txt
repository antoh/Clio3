1 Dear Christians, one and all, rejoice,

With exultation springing,

And, with united heart and voice

And holy rapture singing,

Proclaim the wonders God hath done,

How His right arm the victory won;

Right dearly it hath cost Him.


2 Fast bound in Satan's chains I lay;

Death brooded darkly o'er me.

Sin was my torment night and day;

In sin my mother bore me.

Yea, deep and deeper still I fell;

Life had become a living hell,

So firmly sin possessed me.


3 My good works so imperfect were,

They had no pow'r to aid me;

My will God's judgments could not bear,

Yea, prone to evil made me;

Grief drove me to despair, and I

Had nothing left me but to die;

To hell I fast was sinking.


4 But God beheld my wretched state

Before the world's foundation,

And, mindful of His mercies great,

He planned my soul's salvation.

A father's heart He turned to me,

Sought my redemption fervently:

He gave His dearest Treasure.


5 He spoke to His beloved Son:

"'Tis time to have compassion.

Then go, bright Jewel of My crown,

And bring to man salvation.

From sin and sorrow set him free;

Slay bitter death for him, that he

May live with Thee forever."


6 This Son obeyed Him cheerfully,

And born of virgin mother,

Came down upn the earth to me

That He might be my Brother.

His mighty power doth work unseen,

He came in fashion poor and mean,

And took the devil captive.


7 He sweetly said: "Hold fast by me,

I am thy Rock and Castle.

Thy Ransom I myself will be;

For thee I strive and wrestle.

For I am with thee, I am thine,

And evermore thou shalt be mine;

The foe shall not divide us.


8 "The foe shall shed My precious blood,

Me of My life bereaving.

All this I suffer for thy good;

Be steadfast and believing.

Life shall from death the vict'ry win,

My innocence shall bear thy sin;

So art thou blest forever.


9 "Now to My Father I depart,

From earth to heav'n ascending,

Thence heav'nly wisdom to impart,

The Holy Spirit sending.

My help to thee extending.

He shall in trouble comfort thee,

Teach thee to know and follow me

And to the truth shall conduct thee.


10 "What I have done and taught, teach thou,

My ways forsake thou never;

So shall My kingdom flourish now

And God be praised forever.

Take heed lest men with base alloy

The heav'nly treasure should destroy;

This counsel I bequeath thee."
