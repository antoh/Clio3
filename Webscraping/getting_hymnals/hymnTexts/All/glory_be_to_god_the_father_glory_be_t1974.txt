1 Glory be to God the Father!

Glory be to God the Son!

Glory be to God the Spirit,

God Eternal, Three in One!


2 Glory be to Him who loved us,

Washed us from each spot and stain!

Glory be to Him who bought us,

Made us kings with Him to reign!


3 Glory to the King of angels!

Glory to the Church's King!

Glory to the King of nations!

Heav'n and earth, your praises bring!


4 Glory, blessing, praise eternal!

Thus the choir of angels sings,

Honor, riches, pow'r, dominion!

thus its praise creation brings.


Amen.
