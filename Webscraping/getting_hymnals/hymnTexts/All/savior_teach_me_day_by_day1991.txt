1.  Savior, teach me day by day

Love's sweet lesson to obey;

Sweeter lesson cannot be,

Loving Him who first loved me.


2.  With a child's glad heart of love

At Thy bidding may I move,

Prompt to serve and follow thee,

Loving Him who first loved me.


3.  Teach me thus Thy steps to trace,

Strong to follow in Thy grace,

Learning how to love from Thee,

Loving Him who first loved me.


4.  Thus may I rejoice to show

That I feel the love I owe;

Singing, till Thy face I see,

Of His love who first loved me.
