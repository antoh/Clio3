Conquering kings their titles take

From the foes they captive make;

Jesus, by a nobler deed,

From the thousands he hath freed.


Yes: none other Name is given

Unto mortals under heaven,

Which can make the dead arise,

And exalt them to the skies.


We would gladly for that Name

Bear the cross, endure the shame;

Joyfully for him to die

Is not death, but victory.


Jesus, who dost condescend

To be called the sinner's Friend,

Hear us, as to thee we pray,

Glorying in thy Name today.


Amen.
