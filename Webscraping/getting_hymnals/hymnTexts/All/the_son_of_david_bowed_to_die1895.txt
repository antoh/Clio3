1 The Son of David bowed to die,

For man's transgression stricken;

The Father's arm of power was nigh,

The Son of God to quicken.

Praise Him that He died for men;

Praise Him that He rose again.


2 Death seemed all-conquering when he bound

The Lord of life in prison;

The night of death was nowhere found

When Christ again was risen;

Wherefore praise Him night and day,

Him who took death's sting away.


3 His saints with Him must bow to death,

With Him are raised in spirit,

With Him they dwell above by faith,

Accepted through His merit;

Heaven and earth resound the strain,

Death by Jesus Christ is slain.


Amen.
