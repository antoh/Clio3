1 By Christ redeemed, in Christ restored,

we keep the memory adored,

and show the death of our dear Lord

until he come.


2 His body, broken in our stead,

is here in this memorial bread,

and so our feeble love is fed

until he come.


3 The drops of his dread agony,

his Life-blood shed for us we see;

the wine shall tell the mystery,

until he come.


4 And thus that dark betrayal night

with the last advent we unite,

by one blest chain of loving rite,  

until he come.


5 Until the trumpet sound be heard,

until the ancient graves be stirred,

and with the great commanding word

the Lord shall come.
