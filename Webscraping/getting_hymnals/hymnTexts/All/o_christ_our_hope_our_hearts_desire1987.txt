PsH
1987
1 O Christ, our hope, our heart's desire, 

redemption's only spring, 

Creator of the world art thou, 

its Savior and its King. 


2 How vast the mercy and the love 

which laid our sins on thee, 

and led thee to a cruel death 

to set thy people free. 


3 But now the bands of death are burst, 

the ransom has been paid; 

and thou art on thy Father's throne, 

in glorious robes arrayed. 


4 O Christ, be thou our lasting joy, 

our ever great reward; 

our only glory may it be 

to glory in the Lord!
