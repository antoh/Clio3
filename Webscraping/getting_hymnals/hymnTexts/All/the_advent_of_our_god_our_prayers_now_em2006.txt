1 The advent of our King

Our prayers must now employ,

And we must hymns of welcome sing

In strains of holy joy.


2 The everlasting Son 

Incarnate deigns to be,

Himself a servant's form puts on

To set His servants free.


3 O Zion's daughter, rise

To meet your lowly King,

Nor let your faithless heart despise

The peace He comes to bring.


4 As judge, on clouds of light,

He soon will come again

And His true members all unite

With Him in heav'n to reign.


5 Before the dawning day

Let sin's dark deeds be gone,

The sinful self be put away,

The new self now put on.


6 All glory to the Son,

Who comes to set us free,

With Father, Spirit, ever one

Through all eternity.
