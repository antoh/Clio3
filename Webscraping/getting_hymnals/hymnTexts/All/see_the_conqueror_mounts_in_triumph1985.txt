1 See, the Conqu'ror mounts in triumph,

see the King in royal state

riding on the clouds, his chariot

to his heav'nly palace gate;

Hark! the choirs of angel voices

joyful Alleluias sing

and the portals high are lifted

to receive their heav'nly King.


2 Who is he that comes in glory

with the trump of jubilee?

Lord of battles, God of armies,

he has gained the victory.

He who on the cross did suffer,

he who from the grave arose,

he has vanquished sin and Satan,

he by death has spoiled his foes.


3 While he lifts his hands in blessing

he is parted from his friends;

while their eager eyes behold him,

he upon the clouds ascends;

he who walked with God and pleased him,

preaching truth and doom to come,

he, our Enoch, is translated

to his everlasting home.


4 Now our heav'nly Aaron enters

with his blood within the veil;

Joshua now is come to Canaan,

and the kings before him quail.

Now he plants the tribes of Israel

in their promised resting place,

now our great Elijah offers

double portion of his grace.


5 He has raised our human nature

on the clouds to God's right hand;

there we sit in heav'nly places,

there with thee in glory stand;

Jesus reigns, adored by angels,

mighty Lord, in thine Ascension

we by faith behold our own.
