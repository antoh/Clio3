1 Alleluia, alleluia! 

Hearts to heav'n and voices raise; 

Sing to God a hymn of gladness, 

Sing to God a hymn of praise; 

He who on the cross a victim 

For the world's salvation bled-- 

Jesus Christ, the King of Glory, 

Now is risen from the dead.

 Alleluia, alleluia! 

Glory be to God on high; 

Alleluia to the Savior 

Who has gained the victory; 

Alleluia to the Spirit, 

Fount of love and sanctity! 

Alleluia, alleluia! 

to the triune Majesty.
