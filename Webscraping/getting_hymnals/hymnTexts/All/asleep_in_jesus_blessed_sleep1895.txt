1 Asleep in Jesus! blessed sleep,

From which none ever wakes to weep;

A calm and undisturbed repose,

Unbroken by the last of foes.


2 Asleep in Jesus! O how sweet

To be for such a slumber meet;

With holy confidence to sing

That death hath lost his venomed sting.


3 Asleep in Jesus! peaceful rest,

Whose waking is supremely blest;

No fear, no woe, shall dim that hour

That manifests the Saviour's power.


4 Asleep in Jesus! O for me

May such a blissful refuge be;

Securely shall my ashes lie,

Waiting the summons from on high.


5 Asleep in Jesus! far from thee

Thy kindred and their graves may be;

But there is still a bless'd sleep,

From which none ever wakes to weep.


Amen.
