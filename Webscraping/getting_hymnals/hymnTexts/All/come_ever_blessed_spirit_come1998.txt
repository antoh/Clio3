1 Come, ever blessed Spirit, come,

and make thy servants' hearts thy home;

may each a living temple be,

hallowed for ever, Lord, to thee.


2 Enrich that temple's holy shrine

with sevenfold gifts of grace divine:

with wisdom, light and knowledge bless,

strength, counsel, fear, and godliness.


3 O Trinity in Unity,

one only God and persons three,

in whom, through whom, by whom we live,

to Thee we praise and glory give:


4 So grant us to receive thy grace,

that we may see thy glorious face,

and ever with the heavenly host

praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
