[before Communion]


1 Here, O my Lord, I see thee face to face;

here would I touch and handle things unseen,

here grasp with firmer hand eternal grace,

and all my weariness upon thee lean.


2 Mine is the sin, but thine the righteousness;

mine is the guilt, but thine the cleansing blood;

here is my robe, my refuge, and my peace --

thy blood, thy righteousness, O Lord, my God.


3 Here would I feed upon the bread of God,

here drink with thee the royal wine of heaven;

here would I lay aside each earthly load,

here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven.


4 This is the hour of banquet and of song;

this is the heavenly table spread for me;

here let me feast, and, feasting, still prolong

this hallowed hour of fellowship with thee.


[after Communion]


5 Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;

the feast, though not the love, is past and gone;

the bread and wine remove, but thou art here,

nearer than ever; still my Shield and Sun.


6 I have no help but thine; nor do I need

another arm but thine to lean upon;

it is enough, my Lord, enough indeed;

my strength is in thy might, thy might alone.


7 Feast after feast thus comes and passes by,

yet, passing, points to the glad feast above,

giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy,

the Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love.
