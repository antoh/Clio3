My God, accept my heart this day,

And make it always thine,

That I from thee no more may stray,

No more from thee decline.

Before the cross of him who died,

Behold, I prostrate fall;

Let every sin be crucified,

And Christ be all in all.

Anoint me with thy heavenly grace

And seal me for thine own;

That I may see thy glorious face,

And worship near thy throne.

Let every thought, and work, and word,

To thee be ever given;

Then life shall be thy service, Lord,

And death the gate of heaven!

Amen.
