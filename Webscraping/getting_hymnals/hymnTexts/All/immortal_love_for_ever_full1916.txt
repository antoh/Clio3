Immortal Love, for ever full,

For ever flowing free,

For ever shared, for ever whole,

A never-ebbing sea!


Our outward lips confess the Name

All other names above;

Love only knoweth whence it came,

And comprehendeth love.


We may not climb the heavenly steeps

To bring the Lord Christ down;

In vain we search the lowest deeps,

For him no depths can drown:


But warm, sweet, tender, even yet

A present help is he;

And faith has still its Olivet,

And love its Galilee.


The healing of his seamless dress

Is by our beds of pain;

We touch him in life's throng and press,

And we are whole again.


Through him the first fond prayers are said

Our lips of childhood frame;

The last low whispers of our dead

Are burdened with his Name.

O Lord, and Master of us all,

Whate'er our name or sign,

We own thy sway, we hear thy call,

We test our lives by thine.


Amen.
