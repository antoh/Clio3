1 Christ Jesus lay in death's strong bands

for our offenses given;

but now at God's right hand he stands,

and brings us life from heaven;

therefore let us joyful be,

and sing to God right thankfully

loud songs of alleluia! Alleluia!


2 It was a strange and dreadful strife

when life and death contended;

the victory remained with life;

the reign of death was ended.

Holy Scripture plainly saith

that death is swallowed up by death;

its sting is lost forever! Alleluia!


3 So let us keep the festival

whereto our Lord invites us.

Christ is himself the joy of all,

the Sun that warms and lights us.

By his grace he doth impart

eternal sunshine to the heart;

the night of sin is ended! Alleluia!


4 Then let us feast this Easter day

on the true bread of heaven;

the word of grace hath purged away

the old and wicked leaven.

Christ alone our souls will feed,

he is our meat and drink indeed;

faith lives upon no other! Alleluia!


uia!
