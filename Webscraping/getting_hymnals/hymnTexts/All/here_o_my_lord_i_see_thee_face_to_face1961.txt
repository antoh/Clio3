Here, O my Lord, I see thee face to face;

Here would I touch and handle things unseen,

Here grasp with firmer hand th'eternal grace,

And all my weariness upon thee lean.

Here would I feed upon the bread of God,

Here drink with thee the royal wine of heav'n;

Here would I lay aside each earthly load,

Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven.

This is the hour of banquet and of song;

This is the heav'nly table spread for me:

Here let me feast, and, feasting, still prolong

The brief, bright hour of fellowship with thee.

I have no help but thine, nor do I need

Another arm save thine to lean upon:

It is enough, my Lord, enough indeed;

My strength is in thy might, thy might alone.

Mine is the sin, but thine the righteousness;

Mine is the guilt, but thine the cleansing blood;

Here is my robe, my refuge, and my peace,

Thy blood, thy righteousness, O Lord my God.
