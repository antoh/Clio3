1 O land of rest for thee I sigh! 

When will the moment come 

When I shall lay my armor by  

And dwell in peace at home?


Chorus:

We'll work (We'll work) till Jesus comes, 

We'll work (We'll work) till Jesus comes, 


2 To Jesus Christ I fled for rest; 

He bade me cease to roam, 

And lean for comfort on His breast 

Till He conducts me home. 


Chorus:

We'll work (We'll work) till Jesus comes, 

And we'll be gathered home
