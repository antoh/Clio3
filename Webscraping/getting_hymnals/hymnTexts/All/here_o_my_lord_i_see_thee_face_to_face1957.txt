1 Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;

Here would I touch and handle things unseen;

Here, grasp with firmer hand eternal grace,

And all my weariness upon Thee lean.


2 Here would I feed upon the bread of God,

Here drink with Thee the royal wine of heav'n,

Here would I lay aside each earthly load,

Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiv'n.


3 I have no help but Thine, nor do I need

Another arm save Thine to lean upon;

It is enough, my Lord, enough indeed;

My strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone.


4 Mine is the sin, but Thine the righteousness;

Mine is the guilt, but Thine the cleansing blood;

Here is my robe, my refuge, and my peace,

Thy blood, Thy righteousness, O Lord, my God.


5 Too soon we rise; but symbols disappear;

The feast, though not the love, is past and gone;

It is enough, my Lord, if Thou art near;

My strength is in Thy love, Thy love alone.


Amen.
