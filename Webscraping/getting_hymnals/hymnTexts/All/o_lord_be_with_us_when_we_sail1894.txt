1 O Lord, be with us when we sail

Upon the lonely deep,

Our Guard, when on the silent deck

The midnight watch we keep.


2 We need not fear, though all around

'Mid rising winds we hear

The multitude of waters surge;

For Thou, O God, art near.


3 The calm, the breeze, the gale, the storm,

The ocean and the land,

All, all are Thine, are held within

The hollow of Thy hand.


4 As when on blue Gennesareth

Rose high the angry wave,

And Thy disciples quailed in dread,

One word of Thine could save;


5 So when the fiercer storms arise

From man's unbridled will,

Be Thou, Lord, present in our hearts

To whisper "Peace be still."


6 If duty calls from threatened strife

To guard our native shore,

And shot and shell are answering

The booming cannon's roar;


7 Be Thou the mainquard of our host,

Till war and dangers cease;

Defend the right, put up the sword,

And through the world make peace.


8 Across this troubled tide of life

Thyself our Pilot be,

Until we reach that better land,

The land that knows no sea.


Amen.
