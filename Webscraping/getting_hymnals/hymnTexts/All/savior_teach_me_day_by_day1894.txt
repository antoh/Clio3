1 Saviour! teach me, day by day,

Love's sweet lesson to obey;

Sweeter lesson cannot be,

Loving Him Who first loved me.


2 With a childlike heart of love,

At Thy bidding may I move;

Prompt to serve and follow Thee,

Loving Him Who first loved me.


3 Teach me all Thy steps to trace,

Strong to follow in Thy grace;

Learning how to love from Thee;

Loving Him Who first loved me.


4 Love in loving finds employ,

In obedience all her joy;

Ever new that joy will be,

Loving Him Who first loved me.


5 Thus may I rejoice to show

That I feel the love I owe;

Singing, till Thy face I see,

Of His love Who first loved me.


Amen.
