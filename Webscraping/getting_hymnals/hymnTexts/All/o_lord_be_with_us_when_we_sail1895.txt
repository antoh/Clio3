1 O Lord, be with us when we sail

Upon the lonely deep,

Our Guard, when on the silent deck

The midnight watch we keep.


2 We need not fear, though all around

'Mid rising winds we hear

The multitude of waters surge;

For Thou, O God, art near.


3 The calm, the breeze, the gale, the storm,

That pass from land to land,

All, all are Thine, are held within

The hollow of Thy hand.


4 If duty calls from threatened strife

To guard our native shore,

And shot and shell are answering

The booming cannon's roar.


5 Be Thou the Mainquard of our host,

Till war and dangers cease;

Defend the right, put up the sword,

And through the world make peace.


6 Across this troubled tide of life

Thyself our Pilot be,

Until we reach that better land,

The land that knows no sea.


7 To Thee the Father, Thee the Son,

Whom earth and sky adore,

And Spirit moving on the deep,

Be praise for evermore.


Amen.
