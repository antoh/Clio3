With glory clad, with strength arrayed,

The Lord, that o'er all nature reigns,

The world's foundations strongly laid,

And the vast fabric still sustains.

How surely stablished is thy throne,

Which shall no change or period see!

For thou, O Lord, and thou alone,

Art God from all eternity.

The floods, O Lord, lift up their voice,

And toss the troubled waves on high;

But God above can still their noise,

And make the angry sea comply.

Thy promise, Lord, is ever sure,

And they that in thy house would dwell,

That happy station to secure,

Must still in holiness excel.
