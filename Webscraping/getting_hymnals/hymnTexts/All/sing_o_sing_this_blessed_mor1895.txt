1 Sing, O sing, this blessed morn;

Unto us a Child is born,

Unto us a Son is given,

God Himself comes down from heaven.


Refrain:

Sing, O sing, this blessed morn,

Jesus Christ to-day is born.


2 God of God, and Light of Light,

Comes with mercies infinite,

Joining in a wondrous plan

Heaven to earth, and God to man. [Refrain]


3 God with us, Emmanuel,

Deigns for ever now to dwell;

And on Adam's fallen race

Sheds the fulness of His grace. [Refrain]


4 God comes down that man may rise,

Lifted by Him to the skies;

He is Son of Man that we

By Him Sons of God may be. [Refrain]


5 O renew us, Lord, we pray,

With thy Spirit day by day,

That we ever one may be

With the Father and with Thee. [Refrain]


Amen.
