1 Hasten, sinner! to be wise;

Stay not for the morrow's sun:

Wisdom, if you still despise,

Harder is it to be won.


2 Hasten, mercy to implore;

Stay not for the morrow's sun;

Lest thy season should be o'er, 

Ere this evening's stage be run.


3 Hasten, sinner! now return;

Stay not for the morrow's sun;

Lest thy lamp should cease to burn,

Ere salvation's work is done.


4 Hasten, sinner! to be blest;

Stay not for the morning's sun;

Lest perdition thee arrest,

Ere the morrow is begun.
