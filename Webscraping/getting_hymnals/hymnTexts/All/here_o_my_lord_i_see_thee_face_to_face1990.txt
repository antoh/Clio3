1 Here, O our Lord, I see you face to face,

here faith can touch and handle things unseen;

I will grasp with firmer hand your grace,

and all my weariness upon you lean.


2 Here I will feed upon the bread of God,

here drink with you the royal wine of heaven;

here I will lay aside each earthly load,

here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven.


3 Mine is the sin, but yours the righteousness;

mine is the guilt, but yours the cleansing blood:

here is my robe, my refuge, and my peace;

your blood, your righteousness, O Lord, my God.


4 Too soon we rise, the symbols disappear;

the feast, though not the love, is past and done:

gone are the bread and wine, but you are here,

nearer than ever, still my shield and sun.


5 Feast after feast thus comes and passes by,

yet, passing, points to that glad feast above;

giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy,

the Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love.
