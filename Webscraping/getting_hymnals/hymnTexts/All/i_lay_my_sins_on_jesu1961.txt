I lay my sins on Jesus,

The spotless Lamb of God;

He bears them all, and frees us

From the accursed load:

I bring my guilt to Jesus,

To wash my crimson stains

White in his blood most precious,

Till not a spot remains.

I lay my wants on Jesus;

All fullness dwells in him;

He heals all my diseases,

He doth my soul redeem:

I lay my griefs on Jesus,

My burdens and my cares;

He from them all releases,

He all my sorrows shares.

I rest my soul on Jesus,

This weary soul of mine;

His right hand me embraces,

I on his breast recline.

I love the Name of Jesus,

Immanuel, Christ, the Lord;

Like fragrance on the breezes

His Name abroad is poured.

I long to be like Jesus,

Meek, loving, lowly, mild;

I long to be like Jesus,

The Father's holy Child;

I long to be with Jesus

Amid the heav'nly throng,

To sing with saints his praises,

To learn the angels' song.
