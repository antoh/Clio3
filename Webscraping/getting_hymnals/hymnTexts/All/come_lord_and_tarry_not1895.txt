1 Come Lord, and tarry not;

Bring the long-looked-for day;

O why these years of waiting here,

These ages of delay?


2 Come, for Thy saints still wait;

Daily ascends their sigh:

The Spirit and the Bride say, "Come":

Dost Thou not hear the cry?


3 Come, for creation groans,

Impatient of Thy stay,

Worn out with these long years of ill,

These ages of delay.


4 Come, and make all things new;

Build up this ruined earth;

Restore our faded Paradise,

Creation's second birth.


5 Come, and bring Thy reign

Of everlasting peace;

Come, take the kingdom to Thyself,

Great King of Righteousness.


Amen.
