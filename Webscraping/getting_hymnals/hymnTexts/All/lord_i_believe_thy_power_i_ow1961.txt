Lord, I believe; thy pow'r I own,

Thy Word I would obey;

I wander comfortless and lone

When from thy truth I stray.

Lord, I believe; but gloomy fears

Sometimes bedim my sight;

I look to thee with pray'rs and tears,

And cry for strength and light.

Lord, I believe; but thou dost know

My faith is cold and weak;

Pity my frailty and bestow

The confidence I seek.

Yes, I believe; and only thou

Canst give my soul relief:

Lord, to thy truth my spirit bow;

Help thou mine unbelief.
