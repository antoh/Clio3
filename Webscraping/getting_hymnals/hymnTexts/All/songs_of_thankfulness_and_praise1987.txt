PsH
1987
1 Songs of thankfulness and praise, 

Jesus, Lord, to you we raise, 

manifested by the star 

to the sages from afar; 

Branch of royal David's stem, 

in your birth at Bethlehem; 


Refrain: 

"You are Christ," by us confessed  

God in flesh made manifest. 


2 Manifest at Jordan's stream, 

Prophet, Priest, and King supreme; 

and at Cana, wedding guest, 

in your Godhead manifest, 

you revealed your power divine, 

changing water into wine;  Refrain 


3 Manifest in making whole 

palsied limbs and fainting soul; 

manifest in valiant fight, 

quelling all the devil's might; 

manifest in gracious will, 

ever bringing good from ill;  Refrain
