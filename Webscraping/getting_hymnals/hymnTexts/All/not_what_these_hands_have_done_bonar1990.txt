1 Not what these hands have done 

can save this guilty soul; 

not what this toiling flesh has borne 

can make my spirit whole. 


2 Not what I feel or do 

can give me peace with God; 

not all my prayers and sighs and tears 

can bear my awful load. 


3 Thy work alone, O Christ,

can ease this weight of sin;

thy blood alone, O Lamb of God,

can give me peace within.


4 Thy love to me, O God,

not mine, O Lord, to thee,

can rid me of this dark unrest,

and set my spirit free.


5 Thy grace alone, O God,

to me can pardon speak;

thy power alone, O Son of God,

can this sore bondage break.


6 I bless the Christ of God; 

I rest on love divine; 

and, with unfaltering lip and heart, 

I call this Savior mine. 


God;

I rest on love divine;

And with unfalt'ring lip and heart

I call this Saviour mine.

This cross dispels each doubt;

I bury in his tomb

Each thought of unbelief and fear,

Each ling'ring shade of gloom.


5 I praise the God of grace;

I trust his truth and might;

He calls me his, I call him mine,

My God, my joy, my light.

'Tis he who saveth me,

And freely pardon gives;

I love because he loveth me,

I live because he lives.
