1 Lord of all being, throned afar,

thy glory flames from sun and star;

centre and soul of every sphere,

yet to each loving heart how near!


2 Sun of our life, thy quickening ray

sheds on our path the glow of day;

Star of our hope, thy softened light

cheers the long watches of the night.


3 Our midnight is thy smile withdrawn,

our noontide is thy gracious dawn,

our rainbow arch thy mercy's sign;

all, save the clouds of sin, are thine.


3 Lord of all life, below, above,

whose light is truth, whose warmth is love,

before thy ever-blazing throne 

we ask no lustre of our own.


4 Grant us thy truth to make us free,

and kindling hearts that burn for thee,

till all thy living altars claim

one holy light, one heavenly flame.
