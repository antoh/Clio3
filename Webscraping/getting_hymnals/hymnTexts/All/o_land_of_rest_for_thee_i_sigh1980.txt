1 O land of rest, for thee I sigh!

When will the moment come

When I shall lay my armor by,

And dwell in peace at home?


Chorus:

We'll work till Jesus comes,

We'll work till Jesus comes,

We'll work till Jesus comes,

And we'll be gathered home.


2 To Jesus Christ I fled for rest;

He bade me cease to roam,

And lean for comfort on His breast

Till He conduct me home. (Chorus)


3 I sought at once my Savior's side,

No more my steps to roam;

With Him I'll brave death's chilling tide,

And reach my heav'nly home. (Chorus)
