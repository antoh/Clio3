1 O Jesus, joy of loving hearts,

the fount of life, the light of all

from every bliss that earth imparts,

we turn, unfilled, to hear your call.


2 Your truth unchanged has ever stood;

you plead with all to call on you,

to those who seek you, you are good,

to those who find you, life is new.


3 We taste your ever-living bread,

and long to feast upon you still;

we drink of you, the fountainhead,

our thirsting souls from you we fill.


4 O Jesus, ever with us stay;

make all our moments calm and bright;

chase the bleak night of sin away;

shed o'er the world your holy light.
aith can hold Thee fast.


5 O Jesus, ever with us stay,

Make all our moments calm and bright;

Chase the dark night of sin away,

Shed o'er the world Thy holy light.
