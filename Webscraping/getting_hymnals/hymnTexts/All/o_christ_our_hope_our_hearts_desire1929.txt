1. O Christ, our hope, our hearts' desire,

Redemption's only spring!

Creator of the world art Thou, 

Its Savior and its King,

Its Savior and its King.


2. How vast the mercy and the love,

Which laid our sins on Thee,

And led Thee to a cruel death,

To set Thy people free!

To set Thy people free!


3. But now the bands of death are burst,

The ransom has been paid;

And Thou art on Thy Father's throne,

In glorious robes arrayed,

In glorious robes arrayed.


4. O Christ, be Thou our present joy,

Our future great reward;

Our only glory may it be

To glory in the Lord!

To glory in the Lord!
