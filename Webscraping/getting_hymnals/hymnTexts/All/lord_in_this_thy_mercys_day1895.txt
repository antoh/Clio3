1 Lord, in this Thy mercy's day,

Ere it pass for aye away

On our knees we fall and pray.


2 Holy Jesus, grant us tears,

Fill us with heart-searching fears,

Ere that awful doom appears.


3 Lord, on us Thy Spirit pour,

Kneeling lowly at thy door,

Ere it close for evermore.


4 By Thy night of agony,

By Thy supplicating cry,

By Thy willingness to die,


5 By Thy tears of bitter woe

For Jerusalem below,

Let us not Thy love forego.


6 'Neath Thy wings let us have place,

Lest we lose this day of grace

Ere we shall behold Thy face.


Amen.
