1 O Christ, our King, Creator, Lord,

Saviour of all who trust thy Word,

To them who seek thee ever near,

Now to our praises bend thine ear.


2 In thy dear cross a grace is found

(It flows from every streaming wound)

Whose pow'r our inbred sin controls,

Breaks the firm bond, and frees our souls.


3 Thou didst create the stars of night;

Yet thou hast veiled in flesh thy light,

Hast deigned a mortal form to wear,

A mortal's painful lot to bear.


4 When thou didst hang upon the tree,

The quaking earth acknowledged thee;

When thou didst here yield up thy breath,

The world grew dark as shades of death.


5 Now in the Father's glory high,

Great Conqu'ror, nevermore to die,

Us by thy mighty pow'r defend,

And reign through ages without end.
