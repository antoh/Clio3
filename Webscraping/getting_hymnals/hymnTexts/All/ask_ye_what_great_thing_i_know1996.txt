1 Ask me what great thing I know

that delights and stirs me so,

what the high reward I win, 

whose the name I glory in:

Jesus Christ, the crucified.


2 Who defeats my fiercest foes?  

Who consoles my saddest woes?  

Who revives my fainting heart, 

healing all that grief imparts?  

Jesus Christ, the crucified.


3 Who is life in life to me?  

Who the death of death will be?  

Who holds all my days secure, 

in God's heart where love is sure?  

Jesus Christ, the crucified.


4 This is that great thing I know; 

this delights and stirs me so:  

faith in Christ who died to save, 

Christ who triumphed o'er the grave,

Jesus Christ, the crucified.
