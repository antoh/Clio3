HRGC1892
1894
1 Lord, lead the way the Saviour went,

By lane and cell obscure;

And let love's treasures still be spent,

Like His, upon the poor.


2 Like Him, through scenes of deep distress,

Who bore the world's sad weight,

We, in their crowded loneliness,

Would seek the desolate.


3 For Thou hast placed us side by side,

In this wide world of ill,

And, that Thy followers may be tried,

The poor are with us still.


4 Mean are all offerings we can make.

But Thou hast taught us, Lord,

If given for the Saviour's sake,

They lose not their reward.


Amen.
