1 O Heavenly Jerusalem,

Of everlasting halls,

Thrice bless'd are the people

Thou storest in thy walls.


2 Thou art the golden mansion,

Where saints forever sing,

The seat of God's own chosen,

The palace of the king.


3 There God for ever sitteth,

Himself of all the crown;

The Lamb, the Light that shineth,

And never goeth down.


4 Naught to this seat approacheth

Their sweet peace to molest;

They sing their God forever,

Nor day nor night they rest.


5 Sure hope doth thither lead us;

Our longings thither tend;

May short-lived toil ne'er daunt us

For joys that cannot end.


6 To Christ, the Sun that lightens

His Church above, below;

To Father, and to Spirit

All things created bow.


Amen.
