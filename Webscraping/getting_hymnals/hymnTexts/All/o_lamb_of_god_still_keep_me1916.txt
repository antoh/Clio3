O Lamb of God, still keep me

Near to thy wounded side!

'Tis only there in safety

And peace I can abide.

What foes and snares surround me!

What lusts and fears within!

The grace that sought and found me

Alone can keep me clean.

'Tis only in thee hiding,

I feel my life secure;

Only in thee abiding,

The conflict can endure:

Thine arm the victory gaineth

O'er every hurtful foe;

Thy love my heart sustaineth

In all its care and woe.

Soon shall my eyes behold thee,

With rapture, face to face;

One half hath not been told me

Of all thy power and grace;

Thy beauty, Lord, and glory,

The wonders of thy love,

Shall be the endless story

Of all thy saints above.

Amen.
