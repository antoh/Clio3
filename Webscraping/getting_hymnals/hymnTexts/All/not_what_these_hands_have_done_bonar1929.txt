1. Not what my hands have done

Can save my guilty soul;

Not what my toiling flesh has borne

Can make my spirit whole.

Not what I feel or do

Can give me peace with God;

Not all my prayers, and sighs, and tears

Can bear my awful load.


2. Thy grace alone, O God,

To me can pardon speak;

Thy pow'r alone, O Son of God,

Can this sore bondage break.

No other work save Thine,

No other blood will do;

No strength save that which is divine

Can bear me safely through.


3. I bless the Christ of God;

I rest on love divine;

And with unfalt'ring lip and heart

I call this Savior mine.

'Tis He that saveth me,

And freely pardon gives;

I love, because He loveth me;

I live, because He lives.
