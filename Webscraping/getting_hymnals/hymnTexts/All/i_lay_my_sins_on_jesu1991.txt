1.  I lay my sins on Jesus,

The spotless Lamb of God;

He bears them all, and frees us

From the accursed load:

I bring my guilt to Jesus,

To wash my crimson stains

White in his blood most precious,

Till not a stain remains.


2. I lay my wants on Jesus;

All fulness dwells in Him;

He heals all my diseases,

He doth my soul redeem:

I lay my griefs on Jesus,

My burdens and my cares;

He from them all releases,

He all my sorrows shares.


3.  I long to be like Jesus,

Strong, loving, lowly, mild;

I long to be like Jesus,

The Father's holy child:

I long to be with Jesus,

Amid the heav'nly throng,

To sing with saints His praises,

To learn the angels' song.
