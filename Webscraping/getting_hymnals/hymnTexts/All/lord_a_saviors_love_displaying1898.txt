1 Lord, a Saviour's love displaying,

Show the heathen lands Thy way;

Thousands still like sheep are straying

In the dark and cloudy day.


2 Shades of death are gathering o'er them,

Lord, they perish from Thy sight!

Let Thine angel go before them;

Bring the Gentiles to Thy light.


3 Fetch them home from every nation,

From the islands of the sea;

By the word of Thy salvation

Call the wanderers back to Thee.


4 Thou their pasture hast provided,

Grant the blessing long foretold;

Let Thy sheep, divinely guided,

Find at last the one true fold.


Amen.
