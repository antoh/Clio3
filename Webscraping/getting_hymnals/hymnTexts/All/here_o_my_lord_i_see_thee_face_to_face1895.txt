1 Here, O my Lord, I see thee face to face;

Here would I touch and handle things unseen;

Here grasp with firmer hand eternal grace,

And all my weariness upon Thee lean.


2 Here would I feed upon the bread of God,

Here drink with Thee the royal wine of heaven;

Here would I lay aside each earthly load,

Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven.


3 This is the hour of banquet and of song;

This is the heavenly table spread for me:

Here let me feast, and feasting, still prolong

The brief, bright hour of fellowship with Thee.


4 I have no help but Thine, nor do I need

Another arm save Thine to lean upon:

It is enough, my Lord, enough indeed;

My strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone.


5 Mine is the sin, but Thine the righteousness;

Mine is the guilt, but Thine the cleansing blood;

Here is my robe, my refuge, and my peace,

Thy Blood, Thy righteousness, O Lord my God!


6 Feast after feast thus comes, and passes by;

Yet passing, points to the glad feast above,

Giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy,

The Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love.


Amen.
