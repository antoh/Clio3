1 Go, labor on: spend, and be spent,

Your joy to do the Father's will;

It is the way the Master went;

Should not the servant tread it still?


2 Go, labor on: 'tis not for naught;

Your earthly loss is heav'nly gain;

Men heed you, love you, praise you not;

The Master praises--what are men?


3 Go, labor on: enough while here

If he shall praise you, if he deign

Your willing heart to mark and cheer:

No toil for him shall be in vain.


4 Go, labor on while it is day:

The world's dark night is hast'ning on.

Speed, speed your work, cast sloth away;

It is not thus that souls are won.


5 Toil on, faint not, keep watch and pray;

Be wise the erring soul to win;

Go forth into the world's highway,

Compel the wand'rer to come in.


6 Toil on, and in your toil rejoice;

For toil comes rest, for exile home;

Soon shshall you hear the Bridegroom's voice,

The midnight peal, "Behold, I come."
