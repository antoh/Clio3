1 My country,' tis of thee, 

sweet land of liberty,

of thee I sing; 

land where my fathers died, 

land of the pilgrims' pride, 

from every mountainside

let freedom ring.


2 My native country, thee, 

land of the noble free,

thy name I love; 

I love thy rocks and rills, 

thy woods and templed hills; 

my heart with rapture thrills,

like that above. 


3 Let music swell the breeze, 

and ring from all the trees

sweet freedom's song; 

let mortal tongues awake; 

let all that breathe partake; 

let rocks their silence break,

the sound prolong. 


4 Our fathers' God, to thee, 

author of liberty,

to thee we sing; 

long may our land be bright 

with freedom's holy light; 

protect us by thy might,

Great God, our King.
