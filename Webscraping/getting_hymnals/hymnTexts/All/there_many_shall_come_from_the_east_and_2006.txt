1 A multitude comes from the east and the west

To sit at the feast of salvation

With Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the blest,

Obeying the Lord's invitation.

Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!


2 O God, let us hear when our Shepherd shall call

In accents persuasive and tender,

That while there is time we make haste, one and all

And find Him, our mighty Defender.

Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!


3 All trials are then like a dream that is past,

Forgotten all trouble and mourning.

All questions and doubts have been answered at last,

When rises the light of that morning.

Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!


4 The heavens shall ring with an anthem more grand

Than ever on earth was recorded.

The blest of the Lord shall receive at His hand

The crown to the victors awarded.

Have mercy upon us, O Jesus!
