PsH
1987
1 Not what my hands have done 

can save my guilty soul; 

not what my toiling flesh has borne 

can make my spirit whole. 

Not what I feel or do 

can give me peace with God; 

not all my prayers and sighs and tears 

can bear my awful load. 


2 Your voice alone, O Lord, 

can speak to me of grace; 

your power alone, O Son of God, 

can all my sin erase. 

No other work but yours, 

no other blood will do; 

no strength but that which is divine 

can bear me safely through. 


3 I praise the Christ of God; 

I rest on love divine; 

and with unfaltering lip and heart 

I call this Savior mine. 

My Lord has saved my life 

and freely pardon gives; 

I love because he first loved me, 

I live because he lives.
