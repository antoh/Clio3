Many a power within earth&#8217;s bosom,

Noiseless, hidden, works beneath;

Hence are seed and leaf and blossom,

Golden ear and clustered wreath.

Wind and frost, and hour and season,

Land and water, sun and shade,&#8212;

Work with these, as bids thy reason,

For they work thy toil to aid.

Sow thy seed and reap in gladness!

Man himself is all a seed;

Hope and hardship, joy and sadness,

Slow the plant to ripeness lead.
