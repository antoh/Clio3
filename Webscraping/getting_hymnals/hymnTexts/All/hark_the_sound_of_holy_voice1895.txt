1 Hark! the sound of holy voices,

Chanting at the crystal sea,

Alleluia! Alleluia!

Alleluia! Lord, to thee!

Multitude which none can number,

Like the stars in glory stands,

Clothed in white apparel, holding

Palms of victory in their hands.


2 They have come from tribulation,

And have washed their robes in blood,

Washed them in the blood of Jesus;

Tried they were, and firm they stood;

Mocked, imprisoned, stoned, tormented,

Sawn asunder, slain with sword,

They have conquered death and Satan

By the might of Christ the Lord.


3 Marching with Thy cross their banner,

They have triumphed, following

Thee the Captain of salvation,

Thee their Saviour and their King;

Gladly, Lord, with Thee they suffered;

Gladly, Lord, with Thee they died;

And by death to life immortal

They were born and glorified.


4 Now they reign in heavenly glory,

Now they walk in golden light,

Now they drink, as from a river,

Holy bliss and infinite;

Love and peace they taste for ever,

And all truth and knowledge see

In the beatific vision

Of the bless'd Trinity.


Amen.
