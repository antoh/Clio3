1 O day of rest and gladness,

O day of joy and light,

O balm of care and sadness,

Most beautiful, most bright;

On thee the high and lowly,

Before th'eternal throne,

Sing, "Holy, holy, holy,"

To the great Three in One.


2 On thee at the Creation

The light first had its birth;

On thee for our salvation

Christ rose from depth of earth;

On thee our Lord victorious

The Spirit sent from heav'n;

And thus on thee, most glorious,

A three-fold light was giv'n.


3 Thou art a cooling fountain

In life's dry, dreary sand;

From thee, like Nebo's mountain,

We view our Promised Land;

A day of sweet reflection,

A day of holy love,

A day of resurrection

From earth to things above.


4 Today on weary nations

The heav'nly manna falls;

To holy convocations

The silver trumpet calls,

Where Gospel-light is glowing

With pure and radiant beams

And living water flowing

With soul-refreshing streams.


5 New graces ever gaining

From this our day of rest,

We reach the rest remaining

To spirits of the blest.

To Holy Ghost be praises,

To Father, and to Son;

The Church her voice upraises

To Thee, blest Three in One.
