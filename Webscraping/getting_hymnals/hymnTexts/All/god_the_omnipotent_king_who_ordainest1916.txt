God the All-terrible! King, who ordainest

Thunder thy clarion, the lightning thy sword;

Show forth thy pity on high where thou reignest,

Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.


God the All-merciful! earth hath forsaken

Thy ways of blessedness, slighted thy word;

Bid not thy wrath in its terrors awaken;

Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.


God the All-righteous One! man hath defied thee;

Yet to eternity standeth thy word,

Falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside thee;

Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.


God the Omnipotent! wisely ordaining

Judgments unsearchable, famine and sword;

Over the tumult of war thou art reigning:

Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.


396

God the All-wise! by the fire of thy chastening,

Earth shall to freedom and truth be restored;

Through the thick darkness thy kingdom is hastening;

Thou wilt give peace in thy time, O Lord.


So shall thy children with thankful devotion,

Praise him who saved them from peril and sword,

Singing in chorus from ocean to ocean,

Peace to the nations, and praise to the Lord.


Amen.
