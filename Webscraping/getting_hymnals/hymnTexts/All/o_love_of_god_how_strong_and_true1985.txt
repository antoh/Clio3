1 O love of God, how strong and true, 

eternal and yet ever new,

uncomprehended and unbought, 

beyond all knowledge and all thought!

O love of God, how deep and great,

far deeper than our deepest hate,

self-fed, self-kindled, like the light,

changeless, eternal, infinite! 


2 O wide embracing, wondrous love,

we read thee in the sky above; 

we read thee in the earth below, 

in seas that swell and streams that flow. 

We read thee best in him who came 

to bear for us the cross of shame, 

sent by the Father from on high

our life to live, our death to die. 


3 We read thy pow'r to bless and save 

e'en in the darkness of the grave; 

still more in resurrection light 

we read the fullness of thy might. 

O love of God, our shield, our stay,

thro' all the perils of our way;

eternal love, in thee we rest,

forever safe, forever blest!
