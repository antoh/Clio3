1 Jesus, thou joy of loving hearts,

thou fount of life, thou light of light,

greater than pleasure earth imparts,

thy love is true and pure delight.


2 Thy gracious word hath ever stood:

thou savest those that on thee call;

to them that seek thee thou art good,

to them that find thee, all in all.


3 We taste thee, O thou living bread,

and long to feast upon thee still;

we drink of thee, the fountainhead,

and thirst our souls from thee to fill.


4 Our restless spirits yearn for thee,

where'er our changeful lost is cast,

glad when thy gracious smile we see,

blest when our faith can hold thee fast.


5 O Jesus, ever with us stay;

make all our moments calm and bright;

banish the sin of earth, we pray;

shed o'er the world thy holy light.
