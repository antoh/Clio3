Was it in vain that Jesus prayed

For those he came to save,

When darkly o&#8217;er his path was laid

The shadow of the grave?

Hath Jesus loved and prayed in vain?

O doubting heart, be still!

Yet holds the Lord his glorious reign,

Despite of wrong and ill.

Though nations with their battle-cries

Profane the Almighty&#8217;s name,

Though bigots to the offended skies

Their own wild wrath proclaim,&#8212;

Thousands, in every Christian land,

Have never bowed the knee

In worship to the idol-band

Of strife and perfidy.

And these are one;&#8212;though some may bend

Before the Virgin&#8217;s shrine,

While others&#8217; prayers and thanks ascend,

Father! alone at Thine,&#8212;

Yet they are one; if through their hearts

The soul of love be poured,

As swells some strain of various parts,

Yet all in sweet accord.
