1 Christ is our cornerstone

on him alone we build;

with his true saints alone

the courts of heaven are filled.

On his great love 

our hopes we place

of present grace 

and joys above.


2 O then, with hymns of praise

these hallowed courts shall ring.

Our voices we will raise

the Three-in-One to sing,

and thus proclaim 

in joyful song,

both loud and long, 

that glorious name.


3 Here, gracious God, do thou

for evermore draw nigh;

accept each faithful vow,

and mark each suppliant sigh.

In copious shower

on all who pray,

each holy day

thy blessings pour.


4 Here may we gain from heaven

the grace which we implore;

and may that grace, once given,

be with us evermore,

until that day 

when all the blest

to endless rest 

are called away.
