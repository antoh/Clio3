1 O Christ, our hope, our heart's desire,

Creation's mighty Lord,

Redeemer of the fallen world,

By holy love outpoured:


2 How vast Your mercy to accept

The burden of our sin

And bow Your head in cruel death

To make us clean within.


3 But now the bonds of death are burst,

The ransom has been paid;

You now ascend the Father's throne

In robes of light arrayed.


4 O let Your mighty love prevail

To purge us of our pride

That we may stand before Your throne

By mercy purified.


5 Jesus Christ, be our lasting joy,

Our future great reward;

Our only glory, may it be

To glory in the Lord!


6 All praise to You, ascended Lord;

All glory ever be

To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

through all eternity!
