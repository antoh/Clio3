1 Breast the wave, Christian,

When it is strongest;

Watch for day, Christian,

When the night's longest;

Onward and onward still

Be Thine endeavor;

The rest that remaineth

Will be forever.


2 Fight the fight, Christian,

Jesus is o'er thee;

Run the race, Christian,

Heaven is before thee;

He Who hath promised

Faltereth never;

He Who hath loved so well,

Loveth forever.


3 Lift thine eye, Christian,

Just as it closeth;

Raise thy heart, Christian,

Ere it reposeth;

Thee from the love of Christ

Nothing shall sever;

And, when thy work is done,

Praise Him forever.


Amen.
