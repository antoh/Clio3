&#8220;No more, on earth no more,

Shall beam for us that eye;

Closed in a strange forgetfulness

Forever it must lie.


&#8220;No more, on earth no more,

Shall we behold that face;

Within the mournful halls of death

Must be its dwelling-place.


&#8220;No more, on earth no more,

Shall those dear lips be heard;

Cold silence there hath fixed its seal,

Breathed is their latest word.&#8221;


&#8217;Tis so fond Nature mourns

Affection&#8217;s broken ties;

But Faith stands forth, she points on high,

Serenely she replies:&#8212;


&#8220;No more, in heaven no more,

That eye is dim with tears;

But bright, and brighter still, the scene

Before its view appears.


&#8220;No more, in heaven no more,

That face a shadow bears;

But looks of light, born of a bliss

Unknown to earth, it wears.


&#8220;No more, in heaven no more,

That voice is faint with pain;

It mingles with angelic bands,

In their enraptured strain.


&#8220;No more, in heaven no more,

The parting grief is known;

But love has all eternity

To look through as its own.&#8221;
