PsH
1987
1 My faith looks up to thee, 

thou Lamb of Calvary, 

Savior divine! 

Now hear me while I pray, 

take all my guilt away. 

O let me from this day 

be wholly thine! 


2 May thy rich grace impart 

strength to my fainting heart, 

my zeal inspire. 

As thou hast died for me, 

O may my love to thee 

pure, warm, and changeless be, 

a living fire! 


3 While life's dark maze I tread 

and griefs around me spread, 

be thou my guide. 

Bid darkness turn to day, 

wipe sorrow's tears away, 

nor let me ever stray 

from thee aside. 


4 When life's swift race is run, 

death's cold work almost done, 

be near to me. 

Blest Savior, then in love 

fear and distrust remove. 

O bear me safe above, 

redeemed and free!
