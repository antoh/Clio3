1 O day of rest and gladness,

O day of joy and light,

O balm of care and sadness,

Most beautiful, most bright;

On thee the high and lowly,

Through ages joined in tune,

Sing "Holy, holy, holy,"

To the great God Triune.


2 On thee, at the creation,

The light first had its birth;

On thee, for our salvation,

Christ rose from depths of earth;

On thee our Lord victorious,

The Spirit sent from heaven;

And thus on thee, most glorious,

A triple light was given.


3 Today on weary nations

The heavenly manna falls;

To holy convocations

The silver trumpet calls,

Where gospel light is glowing

With pure and radiant beams,

And living water flowing

With soul-refreshing streams.


4 New graces ever gaining

From this our day of rest,

We reach the rest remaining

To spirits of the blest;

To Holy Ghost be praises,

To Father and to Son;

The Church her voice upraises

To Thee, blest Three in One.


Amen.
