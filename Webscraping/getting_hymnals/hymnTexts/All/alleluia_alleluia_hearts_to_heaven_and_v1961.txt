Alleluia! Alleluia!

Hearts to heav'n and voices raise;

Sing to God a hymn of gladness,

Sing to God a hymn of praise:

He who on the cross a victim

For the world's salvation bled.

Jesus Christ, the King of Glory,

Now is risen from the dead.

Christ is risen, Christ the firstfruits

Of the holy harvest field,

Which will all its full abundance

At his second coming yield:

Then the golden ears of harvest

Will their heads before him wave,

Ripened by his glorious sunshine

From the furrows of the grave.

Alleluia! Alleluia!

Glory be to God on high;

Alleluia to the Saviour,

Who has won the victory;

Alleluia to the Spirit,

Fount of love and sanctity;

Alleluia! Alleluia!

To the Triune Majesty.
