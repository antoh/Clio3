1 Take me, O my Father, take me;

Take me, save me, through thy Son;

That which thou wouldst have me, make me,

Let thy will in me be done.

Long from thee my footsteps straying,

Thorny proved the way I trod;

Weary come I now, and praying,

Take me to thy love, my God.


2 Fruitless years with grief recalling,

Humbly I confess my sin;

At thy feet, O Father, falling,

To thy household take me in.

Freely now to thee I proffer

This relenting heart of mine;

Freely life and soul I offer,

Gift unworthy love like thine.


3 Once the world's Redeemer, dying,

Bore our sins upon the tree;

On that sacrifice relying,

Now I look in hope to thee:

Father, take me; all forgiving,

Fold me to thy loving breast;

In thy love for ever living

I must be for ever blest.
