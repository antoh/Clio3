1 Crown Him with many crowns,

The Lamb upon His throne;

Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns

All music but its own:

Awake, my soul, and sing

Of Him Who died for thee,

And hail Him as thy matchless King

Thro' all eternity.


2 Crown Him the Son of God

Before the worlds began,

And ye, who tread where he hath trod,

Crown Him the Son of Man;

Who every grief hath known

That wrings the human breast,

And takes and bears them for His own,

That all in Him may rest.


3 Crown Him the Lord of Life,

Who triumphed o'er the grave,

And rose victorious in the strife

For those He came to save;

His glories now we sing

Who died, and rose on high,

Who died, eternal life to bring,

And lives that death may die.


4 Crown Him of lords the Lord,

Who over all doth reign,

Who once on earth, the Incarnate Word,

For ransomed sinners slain,

Now lives in realms of light,

Where saints and angels sing

Their songs before Him day and night,

Their God, Redeemer, King.


5 Crown Him the Lord of heaven,

Enthroned in worlds above;

Crown Him the King, to whom is given,

The wondrous name of Love.

Crown Him with many crowns,

As thrones before Him fall,

Crown Him, ye kings, with many crowns,

For He is King of all.


Amen.
