1. As now the sun's declining rays

Towards the eve descend,

E'en so our years are sinking down

To their appointed end.


2. Lord, on the cross Thine arms were stretched

To draw us to the sky;

O grant us then that cross to love,

And in those arms to die.


3. To God the Father, God the Son,

And God the Holy Ghost,

All glory be from saints on earth,

And from the angel host.


Amen.
