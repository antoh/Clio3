1. I was a wand'ring sheep,

I did not love the fold,

I did not love my Shepherd's voice,

I would not be controlled;

I was a wayward child,

I did not love my home,

I did not love my Father's voice,

I loved afar to roam.


2. The Shepherd sought His sheep,

The Father sought His child;

He followed me o'er vale and hill,

O'er deserts waste and wild:

He found me nigh to death,

Famished, and faint, and lone,

He bound me with the bands of love,

He saved the wand'ring one.


3. Jesus my Shepherd is;

'Twas He that loved my soul,

'Twas He that washed me in His blood,

'Twas He that made me whole:

'Twas He that sought the lost,

That found the wand'ring sheep,

'Twas He that brought me to the fold,

'Tis He that still doth keep.


4. I was a wand'ring sheep,

I would not be controlled,

But now I love my Shepherd's voice,

I love, I love the fold:

I was a wayward child,

I once preferred to roam;

But now I love my Father's voice,

I love, I love His home!
