I'm but a stranger here,

Heav'n is my home;

Earth is a desert drear,

Heav'n is my home;

Danger and sorrow stand

Round me on ev'ry hand;

Heav'n is my fatherland,

Heav'n is my home.

What though the tempest rage,

Heav'n is my home;

Short is my pilgrimage,

Heav'n is my home;

And time's wild wintry blast

Soon shall be over past;

I shall reach home at last,

Heav'n is my home;

There, at my Saviour's side,

Heav'n is my home;

I shall be glorified,

Heav'n is my home;

There are the good and blest,

Those I love most and best;

And there I too shall rest,

Heav'n is my home;

Therefore I murmur not,

Heav'n is my home;

Whate'er my earthly lot,

Heav'n is my home;

And I shall surely stand

There at my Lord's right hand;

Heav'n is my fatherland,

Heav'n is my home.
