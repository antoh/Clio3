1 I lay my sins on Jesus,

The spotless Lamb of God;

He bears them all and frees us

From the accursed load.

I bring my guilt to Jesus

To wash my crimson stains

White in His blood most precious

Till not a spot remains.


2 I lay my wants on Jesus,

All fulness dwells in Him;

He heals all my diseases,

My soul He does redeem.

I lay my griefs on Jesus,

My burdens and my cares;

He from them all releases,

He all my sorrows shares.


3 I rest my soul on Jesus,

This weary soul of mine;

His right hand me embraces,

I on His breast recline.

I love the name of Jesus,

Immanuel, Christ, the Lord;

Like fragrance on the breezes

His name abroad is poured.
