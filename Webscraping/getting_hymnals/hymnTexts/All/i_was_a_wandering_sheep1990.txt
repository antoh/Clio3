1 I was a wand'ring sheep,

I did not love the fold;

I did not love my Shepherd's voice,

I would not be controlled.

I was a wayward child,

I did not love my home;

I did not love my Father's voice,

I loved afar to roam.


2 The Shepherd sought his sheep,

The Father sought his child;

They followed me o'er vale and hill,

O'er deserts waste and wild:

They found me nigh to death,

Famished and faint and lone;

They bound me with the bands of love,

They saved the wand'ring one.


3 Jesus my Shepherd is;

'Twas he that loved my soul,

'Twas he that washed me in his blood,

'Twas he that made me whole;

'Twas he that sought the lost,

That found the wand'ring sheep,

'Twas he that brought me to the fold,

'Tis he that still doth keep.


4 I was a wand'ring sheep,

I would not be controlled;

But now I love my Shepherd's voice,

I love, I love the fold.

I was a wayward child,

I once preferred to roam;

But now I love my Father's voice,

I love, I love his home.
