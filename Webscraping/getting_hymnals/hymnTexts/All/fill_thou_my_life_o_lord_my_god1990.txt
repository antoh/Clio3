1 Fill thou my life, O Lord my God,

In ev'ry part with praise,

That my whole being may proclaim

Thy being and thy ways.


2 Not for the lip of praise alone,

Nor e'en the praising heart,

I ask, but for a life made up

Of praise in ev'ry part;


3 Praise in the common things of life,

Its goings out and in,

Praise in each duty and each deed,

However small and mean.


4 Fill ev'ry part of me with praise;

Let all my being speak

Of thee and of they love, O Lord,

Poor though I be, and weak.


5 So shalt thou, Lord, from me, e'en me,

Receive the glory due,

And so shall I begin on earth

The song for ever new.


6 So shall no part of day or night

From sacredness be free:

But all my life, in ev'ry step,

Be fellowship with thee.
