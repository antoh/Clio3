1 O day of rest and gladness,

O day of joy and light,

O balm of care and sadness,

most beautiful, most bright!

On thee the high and lowly

before th'eternal throne

sing "Holy, holy, holy"

to the great Thee-in-One.


2 On thee at the creation,

the light first had its birth,

on thee for our salvation

Christ rose from depths of earth;

on thee our Lord victorious,

the Spirit sent from heav'n,

and thus on thee most glorious,

a triple light was giv'n.


3 New graces ever gaining

from this our day of rest,

we reach the rest remaining

to spirits of the blest.

To Holy Ghost be praises,

to Father and to Son;

the church her voice upraises

to thee, blest Three-in-One.
