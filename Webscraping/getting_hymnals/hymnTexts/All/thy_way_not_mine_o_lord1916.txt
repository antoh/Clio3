Thy way, not mine, O Lord,

However dark it be:

Lead me by thine own hand:

Choose out the path for me.

Smooth let it be or rough,

It will be still the best;

Winding or straight, it leads

Right onward to thy rest.

I dare not choose my lot;

I would not, if I might;

Choose thou for me, my God:

So shall I walk aright.

Take thou my cup, and it

With joy or sorrow fill,

As best to thee may seem;

Choose thou my good and ill.

Choose thou for me my friends,

My sickness or my health;

Choose thou my cares for me

My poverty or wealth.

Not mine, not mine the choice,

In things or great or small

Be thou my Guide, my Strength,

My Wisdom, and my All.

Amen.
