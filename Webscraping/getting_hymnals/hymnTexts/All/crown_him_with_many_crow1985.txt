1 Crown him with many crowns, 

the Lamb upon his throne;

hark! how the heav'nly anthem drowns 

all music but its own;

awake, my soul, and sing 

of him who dies for thee,

and hail him as thy matchless King 

through all eternity.


2 Crown him the Lord of love, 

behold his hands and side,

rich wounds, yet visible above, 

in beauty glorified:

no angel in the sky 

can fully bear that sight,

but downward bends his burning eye 

at mysteries so bright.


3 Crown him the Lord of years,

the Potentate of time;

creator of the rolling spheres, 

ineffably sublime:

all hail, Redeemer, hail! 

for thou hast died for me;

thy praise shall never, never fail

throughout eternity.



e to bring, 

and lives that death may die.


4 Crown him of lords the Lord,  

who over all doth reign,

who once on earth, the incarnate Word, 

for ransomed sinners slain,

now lives in realms of light, 

where saints with angels sing

their songs before him day and night, 

their God, Redeemer, King.


5 Crown him the Lord of heaven,

enthroned in worlds above;

crown him the King,to whom is given, 

the wondrous name of Love.

Crown him with many crowns,

as thrones before him fall,

crown him, ye kings, with many crowns,

for he is King of all.
