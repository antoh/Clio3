1 Here, O our Lord, I see thee face to face,

here would I touch and handle things unseen;

here grasp with firmer hand eternal grace,

and all my weariness upon thee lean.


2 Here I will feed upon the bread of God,

here drink with thee the royal wine of heav'n;

here would I lay aside each earthly load;

here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiv'n.


3 Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;

the feast, tho' not the love, is past and gone;

the bread and wine remove, but thou art here--

nearer than ever--still my shield and sun.


4 Feast after feast thus comes and passes by;

yet, passing, points to that glad feast above--

giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy,

the Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love.
