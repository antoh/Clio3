1 Behold the Lamb of God!

0 Thou for sinners slain,

Let it not be in vain

That Thou hast died!

Thee for my Savior let me take,

My only refuge let me make

Thy pierced side.


2 Behold the Lamb of God!

Into the sacred flood

Of Thy most precious blood

My soul I cast.

Wash me and make me pure and clean,

Uphold me through life's changeful scene,

Till all be past.


3 Behold the Lamb of God!

All hail, incarnate Word!

Thou everlasting Lord,

Purge out our leav'n.

Clothe us with godliness and good;

Feed us with Thy celestial food,

Manna from heav'n.


4 Behold the Lamb of God!

Worthy is He alone

To sit upon the throne

Of God above,

One with the Ancient of all days,

One with the Paraclete in praise,

All Light, all Love!
