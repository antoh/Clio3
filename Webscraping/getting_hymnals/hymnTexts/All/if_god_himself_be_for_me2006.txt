1 If God Himself be for me,

I may a host defy;

For when I pray, before me

My foes, confounded, fly.

If Christ, the head and master,

Befriend me from above,

What foe or what disaster

Can drive me from His love?


2 I build on this foundation,

That Jesus and his blood

Alone are my salvation,

My true, eternal good.

Without Him all that pleases

Is valueless on earth;

The gifts I have from Jesus 

Alone have priceless worth.


3 Christ Jesus is my splendor,

My sun, my light, alone;

Were He not my defender

Before God's judgment throne,

I never should find favor

And mercy in His sight

But be destroyed forever

As darkness by the light. 


4 He canceled my offenses,

Delivered me from death;

He is the Lord who cleanses

My soul from sin through faith.

In Him I can be cheerful,

Courageous on my way;

In Him I am not fearful

Of God's great Judgment Day.


5 For no one can condemn me

Or set my hope aside;

Now hell no more can claim me;

Its fury I deride.

No sentence now reproves me,

No guilt destroys my peace;

For Christ, my Savior, loves me

And shields me with His grace.


6 Who clings with resolution

To Him whom Satan hates

Must look for persecution;

For him the burden waits

Of mock'ry, shame, and losses

Heaped on his blameless head;

A thousand plagues and crosses

Will be his daily bread.


7 From me this is not hidden,

Yet am I not afraid;

I leave my cares, as bidden,

To whom my vows were paid.

Though life from me be taken

And ev'rything I own

I trust in You unshaken

And cleave to You alone.


8 No danger, thirst, or hunger,

No pain or poverty,

No earthly tyrant's anger

Shall ever vanquish me.

Though earth should break asunder,

My fortress You shall be;

No fire or sword or thunder

Shall sever You from me.


 9 No angel and no gladness,

No throne, no pomp, no show,

No love, no hate, no sadness,

No pain, no depth of woe,

No scheming, no contrivance,

No subtle thing or great

Shall draw me from Your guidance

Nor from You separate.


10 My heart with joy is springing;

I am no longer sad.

My soul is filled with singing;

Your sunshine makes me glad.

The sun that cheers my spirit

Is Jesus Christ, my King;

The heav'n I shall inherit

Makes me rejoice and sing.
