PsH
1987
1 O Jesus, joy of loving hearts, 

the fount of life, the light of men, 

from fullest bliss that earth imparts 

we turn unfilled to you again. 


2 Your truth unchanged has ever stood; 

you save all those who on you call. 

To those who seek you, you are good; 

to those who find you, all in all. 


3 We taste you, ever-living Bread, 

and long to feast upon you still; 

we drink of you, the fountainhead, 

our thirst to quench, our souls to fill. 


4 Our restless spirits yearn for you 

where'er our changeful lot is cast; 

glad when you smile on us anew, 

blest that our faith can hold you fast. 


5 O Jesus, ever with us stay; 

make all our moments calm and bright! 

Chase the dark night of sin away; 

shed o'er the world your holy light!
