There is no sorrow, Lord, too light

To bring in pray'r to thee;

There is no anxious care too slight

To wake thy sympathy.

Thou, who hast trod the thorny road,

Wilt share each small distress;

The love, which bore the greater load,

Will not refuse the less.

There is no secret sigh we breathe,

But meets thine ear divine;

And ev'ry cross grows light beneath

The shadow, Lord, of thine.

Life's ills without, sin's strife within,

The heart would overflow,

But for that love which died for sin,

That love which wept with woe.
