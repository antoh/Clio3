1 What star is this with beams so bright,

More lovely than the noonday light?

'Tis sent to announce a newborn king,

Glad tidings of our God to bring.


2 'Tis now fulfilled what God decreed,

From Jacob shall a star proceed;

And lo! the eastern sages stand,

To read in heaven the Lord's command.


3 O Jesus, while the star of grace

Inpels us on to seek your face,

Let not our slothful hearts refuse

The guidance of your light to use. 


4 To God Creator, heavenly light,

To Christ, revealed in earthly night

To God the Spirit blest we raise

An endless song of thankful praise!
