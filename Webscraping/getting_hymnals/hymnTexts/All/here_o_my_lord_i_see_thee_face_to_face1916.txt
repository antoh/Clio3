Here, O my Lord, I see thee face to face;

Here would I touch and handle things unseen;

Here grasp with firmer hand eternal grace,

And all my weariness upon thee lean.

Here would I feed upon the Bread of God;

Here drink with thee the royal Wine of heaven;

Here would I lay aside each earthly load,

Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven.

305

I have no help but thine; nor do I need

Another arm save thine to lean upon;

It is enough, my Lord, enough indeed;

My strength is in thy might, thy might alone.

Mine is the sin, but thine the righteousness:

Mine is the guilt, but thine the cleansing Blood:

Here is my robe, my refuge, and my peace;

Thy Blood, thy righteousness, O Lord my God!

Amen.
