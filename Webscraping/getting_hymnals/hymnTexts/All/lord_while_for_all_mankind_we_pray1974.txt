1 Lord, while for all mankind we pray,

Of every clime and coast,

O hear us for our native land,

The land we love the most.


2 O guard our shores from every foe;

With peace our borders bless;

Our cities with prosperity,

Our fields with plenteousness.


3 Unite us in the sacred love

Of knowledge, truth, and Thee,

And let our hills and valleys shout

The songs of liberty.


4 Lord of the nations, thus to Thee

Our country we commend;

Be Thou her refuge and her trust,

Her everlasting friend.


Amen.
