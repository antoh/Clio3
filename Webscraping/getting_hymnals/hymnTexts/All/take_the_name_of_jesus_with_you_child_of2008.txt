1 Take the name of Jesus with you,

Child of sorrow and of woe;

It will joy and comfort give you,

Take it then where'er you go.


Chorus:

Precious name, oh how sweet!

Hope of earth and joy of heav'n;

Precious name, oh how sweet!

Hope of earth and joy of heav'n;


2 Take the name of Jesus ever

As a shield from ev'ry snare;

When temptations round you gather,

Breathe that holy name in prayer.


[Chorus]


3 Oh, the precious name of Jesus!

How it thrills our souls with joy,

When His loving arms receive us

And His songs our tongues employ.


[Chorus]


4 At the name of Jesus bowing,

Falling prostrate at His feet,

King of kings in heav'n we'll crown Him

When our journey is complete.


[Chorus]
