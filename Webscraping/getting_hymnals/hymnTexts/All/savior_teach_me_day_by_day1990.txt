1 Saviour, teach me, day by day,

Love's sweet lesson to obey;

Sweeter lesson cannot be,

Loving him who first loved me.


2 With a child's glad heart of love,

At thy bidding may I move;

Prompt to serve and follow thee,

Loving him who first loved me.


3 Teach me thus thy steps to trace,

Strong to follow in thy grace;

Learning how to love from thee,

Loving him who first loved me.


4 Love in loving finds employ,

In obedience all her joy;

Ever new that joy will be,

Loving him who first loved me.
