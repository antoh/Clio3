1 My God, accept my heart this day,

and make it always thine,

that I from thee no more may stray,

no more from thee decline.


2 Before the cross of him who died,

behold, I prostrate fall;

let every sin be crucified,

and Christ be all in all.


3 Anoint me with thy heavenly grace,

and seal me for thine own,

that I may see thy glorious face,

and worship near thy throne.


4 Let every thought and work and word,

to thee be ever given;

then life shall be thy service, Lord,

and death the gate of heaven.
