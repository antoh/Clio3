1 Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;

Here would I touch and handle things unseen,

Here grasp with firmer hand th'eternal grace,

And all my weariness upon Thee lean.


2 Here would I feed upon the bread of God;

Here drink with Thee the royal wine of heav'n;

Here would I lay aside each earthly load,

Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiv'n.


3 Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;

The feast, tho' not the love, is passed and gone;

The bread and wine remove, but Thou art here--

Nearer than ever--still my Shield and Sun.


4 Feast after feast thus comes and passes by;

Yet, passing, points to the glad feast above--

Giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy,

The Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love.
