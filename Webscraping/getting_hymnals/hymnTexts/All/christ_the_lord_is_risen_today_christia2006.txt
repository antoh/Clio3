1 Christ the Lord is ris'n today; Alleluia!

Christians, hasten on your way; Alleluia!

Offer praise with love replete, Alleluia!

At the paschal victim's feet. Alleluia!


2 For the sheep the Lamb has bled, Alleluia!

Sinless in the sinner's stead. Alleluia!

Christ the Lord is ris'n on high; Alleluia!

Now He lives no more to die. Alleluia!


3 Hail, the victim undefiled, Alleluia!

God and sinners reconciled, Alleluia!

When contending death and life, Alleluia!

Met in strange and awesome strife. Alleluia!


4 Christians, on this holy day, Alleluia!

All your grateful homage pay; Alleluia!

Christ the Lord is ris'n on high; Alleluia!

Now He lives, no more to die. Alleluia!
