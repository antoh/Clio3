1. Sing, O sing, this bless'd morn,

unto us a Child is born,

unto us a Son is given,

God Himself comes down from heaven.


Refrain:

Sing, O sing, this bless'd morn,

Jesus Christ today is born.


2 God from God, and Light from Light,

comes with mercies infinite,

from high heaven he comes to earth,

one with us in human birth. (Refrain)


3 God with us, Emmanuel,

deigns forever now to dwell;

he on Adam's fallen race

sheds the fullness of his grace. (Refrain)


4 God comes down that we may rise,

lifted by him to the skies;

Christ is born for us that we

born again in him may be. (Refrain)


5 O renew us, Lord, we pray,

with thy Spirit day by day,

that we ever one may be

with the Father and with thee. (Refrain)
