1 I heard the voice of Jesus say, 

"Come unto me and rest; 

Lay down, O weary one, lay down 

Your head upon my breast." 

I came to Jesus as I was, 

So weary, worn, and sad; 

I found in him a resting place, 

And he has made me glad. 


2 I heard the voice of Jesus say, 

"Behold, I freely give 

The living water; thirsty one, 

Stoop down and drink and live." 

I came to Jesus and I drank 

Of that life-giving stream; 

My thirst was quenched, my soul revived, 

And now I live in him. 


3 I heard the voice of Jesus say, 

"I am this dark world's light; 

Look unto me, your morn shall rise, 

And all your day be bright." 

I looked to Jesus and I found 

In him my star, my sun; 

And in that light of life I'll walk 

Till trav'ling days are done.
