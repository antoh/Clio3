1 Thy works, not mine, O Christ,

Speak gladness to this heart;

They tell me all is done;

They bid my fear depart.


Refrain:

To whom, save thee,

Who canst alone

For sin atone,

Lord, shall I flee?


2 Thy pains, not mine, O Christ,

Upon the shameful tree,

Have paid the law's full price

And purchased peace for me. (Refrain)


3 Thy cross, not mine, O Christ,

Has borne the awful load

Of sins that none in heav'n

Or earth could bear but God. (Refrain)


4 Thy righteousness, O Christ,

Alone can cover me:

No righteousness avails

Save that which is of thee. (Refrain)
