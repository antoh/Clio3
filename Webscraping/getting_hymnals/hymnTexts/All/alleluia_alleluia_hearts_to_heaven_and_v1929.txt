1. Alleluia!  Alleluia!

Hearts to heav'n and voices raise;

Sing to God a hymn of gladness,

Sing to God a hymn of praise:

He who on the cross a Victim

For the world's salvation bled,

Jesus Christ, the King of Glory,

Now is risen from the dead.


. Christ is risen, Christ the firstfruits

Of the holy harvest-field,

Which will all its full abundance

At His second coming yield:

Then the golden ears of harvest

Will their heads before Him wave,

Ripened by His glorious sunshine

From the furrows of the grave.


. Alleluia!  Alleluia!

Glory be to God on high;

To the Father, and the Savior

Who has gained the victory;

Glory to the Holy Spirit,

Fount of love and sanctity;

Alleluia!  Alleluia!

To the Triune Majesty.
