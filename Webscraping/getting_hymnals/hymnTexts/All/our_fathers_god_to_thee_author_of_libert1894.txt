1 Our father's God! to Thee,

Author of liberty,

To Thee we sing:

Long may our land be bright

With freedom's holy light;

Protect us by Thy might,

Great God, our King!


2 Bless Thou our native land!

Firm may she ever stand,

Through storm and night;

When the wild tempests rave,

Ruler of wind and wave,

Do Thou our country save

By Thy great might.


3 For her our prayer shall rise

To God, above the skies;

On Him we wait;

Thou Who art ever nigh,

Guarding with watchful eye,

To Thee aloud we cry,

God save the state!


Amen.
