1. Hark! the sound of holy voices,

Chanting at the crystal sea,

Halleluia, halleluia,

Halleluia, Lord, to Thee!

Multitudes which none can number

Like the stars in glory stand,

Clothed in white apparel, holding

Palms of vict'ry in their hand.


2. They have come from tribulation,

And have washed their robes in blood,

Washed them in the blood of Jesus;

Tried they were, and firm they stood;

Mocked, imprisoned, stoned, tormented,

Sawn asunder, slain with sword,

They have conquered death and Satan

By the might of Christ the Lord.


3. Now they reign in heav'nly glory,

Now they walk in golden light,

Now they drink, as from a river,

Holy bliss and infinite:

Love and peace they taste forever,

Heav'nly truth and knowledge see

In the beatific vision

Of the blessed Trinity.
