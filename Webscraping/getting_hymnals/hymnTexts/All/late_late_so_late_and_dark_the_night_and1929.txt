1. Late, late, so late! and dark the night and chill!

Late, late, so late! but we can enter still.

Too late, too late, ye cannot enter now;

Too late, too late, ye cannot enter now.


2. No light had we; for that we do repent,

And learning this, the Bridegroom will relent.

Too late, too late, ye cannot enter now;

Too late, too late, ye cannot enter now.


3. No light, so late, and dark and chill the night,

O let us in that we may find the light.

Too late, too late, ye cannot enter now;

Too late, too late, ye cannot enter now.
