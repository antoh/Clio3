1 Songs of thankfulness and praise,

Jesus Christ, to you we raise,

manifested by the star,

to the sages from afar;

branch of royal David's stem

in your birth at Bethlehem;

anthems be to you addressed

God in flesh made manifest.


2 Manifest at Jordan's stream,

Prophet, Priest and King supreme;

and at Cana wedding-guest

in your Godhead manifest;

manifest in power divine,

changing water into wine:

anthems be to you addressed

God in flesh made manifest.


3 Manifest in making whole

palsied limbs and fainting soul;

manifest in valiant fight,

quelling all the devil's might;

manifest in gracious will,

ever bringing good from ill:

anthems be to you addressed

God in flesh made manifest.


4 Grant us grace to see you, Lord,

mirrored in your holy Word;

with your grace our lives endow,

grace to imitate you now,

that we like to you may be

at your great epiphany;

anthems be to you addressed

God in flesh made manifest.
