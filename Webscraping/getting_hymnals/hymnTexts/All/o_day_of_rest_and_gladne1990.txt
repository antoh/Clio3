1 O day of rest and gladness,

O day of joy and light,

O balm of care and sadness,

Most beautiful, most bright;

On you the high and lowly,

Through ages joined in tune,

Sing Holy, Holy, Holy,

To the great God Triune,


2 On you, at the creation,

The light first had its birth;

On you, for our salvation,

Christ rose from depths of earth;

On you our Lord, victorious,

The Spirit sent from heav'n;

And thus on you, most glorious,

A triple light was giv'n.


3 You are a port protected

From storms that round us rise;

A garden intersected

With streams of Paradise;

You are a cooling fountain

In life's dry, dreary sand;

From thee, like Pisgah's mountain,

We view the promised land.


4 Today on weary nations

The heav'nly manna falls;

To holy convocations

The silver trumpet calls,

Where gospel light is glowing

With pure and radiant beams,

And living water flowing

With soul-refreshing streams.


5 New graces ever gaining

From this our day of rest,

We reach the rest remaining

To spirits of the blest.

To Holy Ghost be praises,

To Father and to Son;

The church her voice upraises

To you, blest Three in One.
