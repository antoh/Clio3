Darkness o&#8217;er the world was brooding

Sadder than Egyptian gloom;

Souls by myriads lay in slumber

Deep as of the sealed tomb.

Earth had lost the links which bound it

To the throne of light above;

Yet an eye was watching o&#8217;er it,

And that eye was full of love.

Like a glorious beam of morning,

Straight a ray pierced through the cloud,

Spirits mightily awakening

From their dark and heavy shroud.

Still that ray shines on and brightens,

Chasing mist and gloom away;

Happy they on whom it gathers

With its full and perfect day!
