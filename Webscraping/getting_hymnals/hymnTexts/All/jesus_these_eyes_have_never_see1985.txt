1 Jesus, these eyes have never seen

that radiant form of thine;

the veil of sense hangs dark between

thy bless'd face and mine.


2 I see thee not, I hear thee not,

yet art thou oft with me;

and earth hath ne'er so dear a spot

as where I meet with thee.


3 Yet, though I have not see, and still

must rest in faith alone;

I love thee, dearest Lord, and will,

unseen, but not unknown.


4 When death these mortal eyes shall seal,

and still this throbbing heart,

the rending veil shall thee reveal,

all glorious as thou art.
