O Lord of hosts! Almighty King!

Behold the sacrifice we bring:

To every arm thy strength impart;

Thy Spirit shed through every heart.

Wake in our breast the living fires,

The holy faith that warmed our sires:

Thy hand hath made our nation free;

To die for her is serving thee.

Be thou a pillared flame to show

The midnight snare, the silent foe;

And when the battle thunders loud,

Still guide us in its moving cloud.

God of all nations! Sovereign Lord!

In thy dread Name we draw the sword,

We lift the starry flag on high

That fills with light our stormy sky.

From treason's rent, from murder's stain,

Guard thou its folds till peace shall reign,

Till fort and field, till shore and sea,

Join our loud anthem, praise to thee!

Amen.
