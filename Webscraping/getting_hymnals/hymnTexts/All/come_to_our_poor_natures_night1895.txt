1 Come to our poor nature's night

With Thy blessed inward light,

Holy Ghost the Infinite,

Comforter Divine.


2 We are sinful -- cleanse us, Lord;

Sick and faint, Thy strength afford;

Lost, until by Thee restored,

Comforter Divine.


3 Orphans are our souls, and poor;

Give us from Thy heavenly store

Faith, love, joy for evermore,

Comforter Divine.


4 Like the dew Thy peace distill;

Guide, subdue our wayward will,

Things of Christ unfolding still,

Comforter Divine.


5 Gentle, awful, Holy Guest,

Make Thy temple in each breast;

There Thy presence be confessed,

Comforter Divine.


6 With us, for us, intercede,

And with voiceless groanings plead

Our unutterable need,

Comforter Divine.


7 In us, "Abba, Father," cry;

Earnest of the bliss on high,

Seal of immortality,

Comforter Divine.


8 Search for us the depths of God;

Upwards, by the starry road,

Bear us to Thy high abode,

Comforter Divine.


Amen.
