1 Crown Him with many crowns,

The Lamb upon His throne;

Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns

All music but its own:

Awake, my soul, and sing

Of Him who died for thee,

And hail Him as thy matchless King

Through all eternity.


2 Crown Him the Lord of love:

Behold His hands and side,

Rich wounds, yet visible above,

In beauty glorified;

No angel in the sky

Can fully bear that sight,

But downward bends His burning eye

At mysteries so bright.


Crown Him the Lord of peace;

Whose power a sceptre sways

From pole to pole, that wars may cease,

Absorbed in prayer and praise;

His reign shall know no end;

And round his pierc'd feet,

Fair flowers of Paradise extend

Their fragrance ever sweet.


Crown Him of Lord of years,

The Potentate of time;

Creator of the rolling spheres

Ineffably sublime:

All hail, Redeemer, hail!

For Thou hast died for me;

Thy praise shall never, never fail

Throughout eternity.


Amen.
