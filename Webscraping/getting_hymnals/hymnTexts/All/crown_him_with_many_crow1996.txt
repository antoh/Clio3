1 Crown him with many crowns, 

the Lamb upon his throne;

hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns 

all music but its own!

Awake, my soul, and sing

of him who died for thee,

and hail him as thy matchless King 

through all eternity.


2 Crown him the Lord of life, 

who triumphed o'er the grave,

and rose victorious in the strife 

for those he came to save.

His glories now we sing, 

who died and rose on high,

who died eternal life to bring, 

and lives that death may die.


3 Crown him the Lord of peace,

whose power a sceptre sways

from pole to pole, that wars may cease,

absorbed in prayer and praise.

His reign shall know no end;

and round his pierc'd feet

fair flowers of Paradise extend

their fragrance ever sweet.


4 Crown him the Lord of love;

behold his hands and side,

rich wounds yet visible above,

in beauty glorified.

All hail, Redeemer, hail!

for thou hast died for me:

thy praise shall never, never fail

throughout eternity.
,

Enthroned in worlds above;

Crown Him the King to whom is giv'n

The wondrous name of Love.

Crown Him with many crowns

As thrones before him fall;

Crown Him, ye kings, with many crowns,

For He is King of all.
