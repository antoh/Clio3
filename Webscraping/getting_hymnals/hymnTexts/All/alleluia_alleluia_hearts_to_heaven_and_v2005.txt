1 Alleluia! Alleluia!

hearts to heaven and voices raise;

sing to God a hymn of gladness,

sing to God a hymn of praise:

he who on the Cross a victim

for the world's salvation bled,

Jesus Christ the King of glory,

now is risen from the dead.


 Christ is risen, Christ the firstfruits

of the holy harvest field,

which will all its full abundance

at his second coming yield;

then the golden ears of harvest

will their heads before him wave,

ripened by his glorious sunshine,

from the furrows of the grave.


 Christ is risen, we are risen;

shed upon us heavenly grace,

rain, and dew, and gleams of glory

from the brightness of thy face;

so that we, with hearts in heaven,

here on earth may fruitful be,

and by angel hands be gathered,

and be ever, Lord, with thee.


 Alleluia! Alleluia!

Glory be to God on high;

Alleluia to the Saviour,

who has gained the victory;

Alleluia to the Spirit,

fount of love and sanctity;

Alleluia! Alleluia!

to the bless'd Trinity.
