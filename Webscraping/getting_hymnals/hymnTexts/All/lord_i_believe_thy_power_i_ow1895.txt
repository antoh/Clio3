1. Lord, I believe; Thy power I own,

Thy Word I would obey;

I wander comfortless and lone

When from Thy truth I stray.


2. Lord, I believe; but gloomy fears

Sometimes bedim my sight;

I look to Thee with prayers and tears,

And cry for strength and light.


3. Lord, I believe; but Thou dost know

My faith is cold and weak;

Pity my fraility, and bestow

The confidence I seek.


4. Yes, I believe; and only Thou

Canst give my soul relief:

Lord, to Thy truth my spirit bow;

Help Thou mine unbelief.


Amen.
