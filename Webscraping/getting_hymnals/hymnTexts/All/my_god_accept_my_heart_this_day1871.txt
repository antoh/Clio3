1 My God, accept my heart this day,

And make it always Thine,

That I from Thee no more may stray,

No more from Thee decline.


2 Before the Cross of Him Who died,

Behold, I prostrate fall;

Let every sin be crucified,

And Christ be all in all.


3 Anoint me with Thy heavenly grace,

And seal me for Thine own;

That I may see Thy glorious face,

And worship near Thy throne.


4 Let every thought, and work, and word,

To Thee be ever given;

Then life shall be Thy service, Lord,

And death the gate of heaven.
