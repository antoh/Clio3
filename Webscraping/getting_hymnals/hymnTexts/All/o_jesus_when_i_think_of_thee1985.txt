1 O Jesus, when I think of thee,

thy manger, cross, and throne,

my spirit trusts exultingly

in thee, and thee alone.


2 I see thee in thy weakness first;

then, glorious from thy shame,

I see thee death's strong fetters burst 

and reach heav'n's mightiest name.


3 O let me share thy holy birth,

thy faith, thy death to sin,

and, strong amidst the toils of earth,

my heav'nly life begin.


4 Then shall I know what means the strain

triumphant of Saint Paul,

To live is Christ, to die is gain:

Christ is my All in all!
