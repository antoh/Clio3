1 Here, O my Lord, I see you face to face,

here would I touch and handle things unseen,

here grasp with firmer hand eternal grace,

and all my weariness upon you lean.


2 Here I will feed upon the bread of God,

here drink with you the royal wine of heaven;

here I will lay aside each earthly load,

here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven.


3 This is the hour of banquet and of song;

this is the heavenly table for me spread;

here let me feast, and feasting, still prolong

the fellowship of living wine and bread.


4 Too soon we rise, the symbols disappear.

The feast, though not the love, is past and gone:

the bread and wine remove, but you are here,

nearer than ever, still my shield and sun.


5 Feast after feast thus comes and passes by,

yet, passing, points to that glad feast above,

giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy,

the Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love.
