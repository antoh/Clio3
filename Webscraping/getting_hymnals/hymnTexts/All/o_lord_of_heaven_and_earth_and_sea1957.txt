1 O Lord of heav'n and earth and sea,

To Thee all praise and glory be;

How shall we show our love to Thee

Who givest all?


2 Thou didst not spare Thine only Son,

But gav'st Him for a world undone,

And freely, with that Bless'd One,

Thou givest all.


3 For souls redeemed, for sins forgiv'n,

For means of grace and hopes of heav'n,

Father, what can to Thee be giv'n

Who givest all?


4 We lose what on ourselves we spend,

We have as treasure without end

Whatever, Lord, to Thee we lend

Who givest all;


5 To Thee, from whom we all derive

Our life, our gifts, our power to give;

O may we ever with Thee live

Who givest all!


Amen.
