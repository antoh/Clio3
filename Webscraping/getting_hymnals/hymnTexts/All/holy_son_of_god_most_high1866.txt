Holy Son of God most high!

Clothed in heavenly majesty,

Many a miracle and sign,

In thy Father&#8217;s name divine,

Manifested forth thy might

In the chosen people&#8217;s sight.

But, O Saviour! not alone

Thus thy glory was made known;

With the mourner thou didst grieve,

Every human want relieve;

Far thy matchless power above

Stands the witness of thy love.

Thou, who by the open grave,

Ere thy voice was raised to save,

Didst with those fond sisters shed

Tears above the faithful dead;

Even thy word of might appears

Less resistless than thy tears.

Lord! it is not ours to gaze

On thy works of ancient days;

But thy love, unchanged and bright,

More than all those works of might,

More than miracle or sign,

Makes us ever, ever thine.
