1 God the Lord is King: before him

earth with all thy nations, wait!

Where the cherubim adore him,

sits our God in royal state.

He is holy; he is holy;

blessed, only Potentate!


2 God the Lord is King of glory;

Zion, tell the world his fame;

ancient Israel, the story

of his faithfulness proclaim:

He is holy; he is holy;

holy is his awesome name.


3 Laws divine to them were spoken

from the pillar of the cloud;

sacred precepts, quickly broken;

fiercely then his vengeance flowed.

He is holy; he is holy;

to the dust their hearts were bowed.


4 But their Father, God, forgave them

when they sought his face once more:

ever ready was to save them,

tenderly did he restore.

He is holy; he is holy;

we too will his grace implore.
