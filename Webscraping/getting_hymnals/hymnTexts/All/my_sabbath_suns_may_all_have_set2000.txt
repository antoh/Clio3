1 As now the sun's declining rays

at eventide descend,

so life's brief day is sinking down

to its appointed end.


2 Lord, on the cross thine arms were stretched

to draw thy people nigh:

O grant us then that cross to love,

and in those arms to die.


3 All glory to the Father be,

all glory to the Son,

all glory, Holy Ghost, to thee,

while endless ages run.
