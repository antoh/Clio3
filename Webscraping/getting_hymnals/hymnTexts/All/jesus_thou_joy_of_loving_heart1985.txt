1 Jesus, thou Joy of loving hearts,

thou fount of life, thou light of all,

from the best bliss that earth imparts

we turn, unfilled, to heed thy call.


2 Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood;

thou savest those that on thee call;

to them that seek thee thou art good,

to them that find thee all in all.


3 We taste thee, O thou living bread,

and long to feast upon thee still;

we drink of thee, the fountainhead

and thirst our souls from thee to fill.


4 Our restless spirits yearn for thee,

where'er our changeful lot is cast,

Glad when thy gracious smile we see,

blest when our faith can hold thee fast.


5 O Jesus, ever with us stay;

make all our moments calm and bright;

chase the dark night of sin away,

shed o'er the world thy holy light.
