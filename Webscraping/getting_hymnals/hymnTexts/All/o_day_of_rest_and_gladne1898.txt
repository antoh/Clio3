1 O day of rest and gladness,

O day of joy and light,

O balm of care and sadness,

Most beautiful, most bright;

On thee, the high and lowly,

Through ages joined in tune,

Sing, Holy, Holy, Holy,

To the great God Triune.


2 On thee, at the creation,

The light first had its birth;

On thee, for our salvation,

Christ rose from depths of earth;

On thee our Lord victorious

The Spirit sent from heaven;

And thus on thee most glorious

A triple light was given.


3 Thou art a port protected

From storms which round us rise;

A garden intersected

With streams of Paradise;

Thou art a cooling fountain

In life's dry dreary sand;

From thee, like Pisgah's mountain,

We view our promised land.


4 To-day on weary nations

The heavenly manna falls;

To holy convocations

The silver trumpet calls,

Where Gospel light is glowing

With pure and radiant beams,

And living water flowing

With soul-refreshing streams.


5 New graces ever gaining

From this our day of rest,

We reach the Rest remaining

To spirits of the blest.

To Holy Ghost be praises,

To Father, and to Son;

The church her voice upraises

To Thee, blest Three in One.


Amen.
