1 O love that casts out fear,

O love that casts out sin,

remain no more without,

but come and dwell within.


2 True sunlight of the soul,

surround us as we go;

so shall our way be safe,

our feet no straying know.


3 Great love of God, come in,

well-spring of heav'nly peace;

thou living water, come:

spring up, and never cease.





4 Love of the living God,

of Father and of Son;

love of the Holy Ghost, 

fill thou each needy one.
