Hark! the sound of holy voices,

Chanting at the crystal sea,

Alleluia! Alleluia!

Alleluia! Lord, to thee:

Multitude, which none can number,

Like the stars in glory stand

Clothed in white apparel, holding

Palms of vict'ry in their hand.

They have come from tribulation,

And have washed their robes in blood,

Washed them in the blood of Jesus;

Tried they were, and firm they stood;

Mocked, imprisoned, stoned, tormented,

Sawn asunder, slain with sword,

They have conquered death and Satan

By the might of Christ the Lord.

Marching with thy cross their banner,

They have triumphed, following

Thee, the Captain of salvation,

Thee, their Saviour and their King;

Gladly, Lord, with thee they suffered;

Gladly, Lord, with thee they died;

And by death to life immortal

They were born and glorified.

God of God, the One-begotten,

Light of light, Emmanuel,

In whose body joined together

All the saints for ever dwell;

Pour upon us of thy fullness

That we may for evermore

God the Father, God the Son, and

God the Holy Ghost adore.
