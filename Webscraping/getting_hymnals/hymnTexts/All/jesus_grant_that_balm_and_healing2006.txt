1 Jesus, grant that balm and healing

In Your holy wounds I find,

Ev'ry hour that I am feeling

Pains of body and of mind.

Should some evil thought within

Tempt my treach'rous heart to sin,

Show the peril, and from sinning

Keep me from its first beginning.


2 Should some lust or sharp temptation

Fascinate my sinful mind,

Draw me to Your cross and passion,

And new courage I shall find.

Or should Satan press me hard,

Let me then be on my guard,

Saying, "Christ for me was wounded,"

That the tempter flee confounded.


3 If the world my heart entices

With the broad and easy road

With seductive, sinful vices,

Let me weigh the awful load.

You were willing to endure.

Help me flee all thoughts impure

And to master each temptation,

Calm in prayer and meditation.


4 Ev'ry wound that pains or grieves me

By Your wounds, Lord, is made whole;

When I'm faint, Your Cross revives me,

Granting new life to my soul.

Yes, Your comfort renders sweet

Ev'ry bitter cup I meet;

For Your all-atoning passion

Has procured my soul's salvation.


5 O my God, my rock and tower,

Grant that in Your death I trust,

Knowing death has lost its power

Since You crushed it in the dust.

Savior, let Your agony

Ever help and comfort me;

When I die be my protection,

Light and life and resurrection.
