1.	Christ Jesus lay in death's strong bands, 

	for our offenses given; 

	but now at God's right hand he stands, 

	and brings us life from heaven; 

	wherefore let us joyful be, 

	and sing to God right thankfully 

	loud songs of Alleluia!  Alleluia! 


2.	It was a strange and dreadful strife 

	when life and death contended; 

	the victory remained with life; 

	the reign of death was ended. 

	Stripped of power, no more it reigns, 

	and empty form alone remains; 

	death's sting is lost forever!  Alleluia! 


3.	So let us keep the festival 

	whereto the Lord invites us; 

	Christ is himself the joy of all, 

	the Sun that warms and lights us. 

	By his grace he doth impart 

	eternal sunshine to the heart; 

	the night of sin is ended! Alleluia! 


4.	Then let us feast this Easter day 

	on the true bread of heaven; 

	the Word of grace hath purged away 

	the old and wicked leaven. 

	Christ alone our souls will feed; 

	he is our meat and drink indeed; 

	faith lives upon no other! Alleluia!
