1 Dear Christians, one and all, rejoice,

With exultation springing,

And with united heart and voice

And holy rapture singing,

Proclaim the wonders God has done,

How His right arm the vict'ry won;

What price our ransom cost Him!


2 Fast bound in Satan's chains I lay;

Death brooded darkly o'er me.

Sin was my torment night and day;

In sin my mother bore me.

But daily deeper still I fell;

My life became a living hell,

So firmly sin possessed me.


3 My own good works all came to naught,

No grace or merit gaining;

Free will against God's jugment fought,

Dead to all good remaining.

My fears increased till sheer despair

Left only death to be my share;

The pangs of hell I suffered.


4 But God had seen my wretched state

Before the world's foundation,

And mindful of His mercies great,

He planned for my salvation.

He turned to me a father's heart;

He did not choose the easy part

But gave His dearest treasure.


5 God said to His beloved Son:

"It's time to have compassion.

Then go, bright jewel of My crown,

And bring to all salvation.

From sin and sorrow set them free;

Slay bitter death for them that they

May live with You forever."


6 The Son obeyed His Father's will,

Was born of virgin mother;

And God's good pleasure to fulfill,

He came to be my brother.

His royal pow'r disguised He bore;

A servant's form, like mine, He wore

To lead the devil captive.


7 To me He said: "Stay close to Me,

I am your rock and castle.

Your ransom I Myself will be;

For you I strive and wrestle.

For I am yours, and you are Mine,

And where I am you may remain;

The foe shall not divide us.


8 "Though he will shed My precious blood,

Me of My life bereaving,

All this I suffer for your good;

Be steadfast and believing.

Life will from death the vict'ry win;

My innocence shall bear your sin,

And you are blest forever.


9 "Now to My Father I depart,

From earth to heav'n ascending,

And, heav'nly wisdom to impart,

The Holy Spirit sending;

In trouble He will comfort you

And teach you always to be true

And into truth shall guide you.


10 "What I on earth have done and taught,

Guide all your life and teaching;

So shall the kingdom's work be wrought

And honored in your preaching.

But watch lest foes with base alloy

The heav'nly treausre should destroy;

This final word I leave you."
