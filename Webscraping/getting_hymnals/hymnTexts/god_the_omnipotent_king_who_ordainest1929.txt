1. God, the All-terrible!  King, who ordainest

Great winds Thy clarions, lightnings Thy sword;

Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest;

Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.


2. God, the All-merciful! earth hath forsaken

Thy way of blessedness, slighted Thy Word;

Bid not Thy wrath in its terrors awaken;

Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.


3. God, the All-righteous One! man hath defied Thee;

Yet to eternity standeth Thy Word;

Falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside Thee;

Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.


4. God, the All-wise! by the fire of Thy chast'ning

Earth shall to freedom and truth be restored;

Thro' the thick darkness Thy kingdom is hast'ning;

Thou wilt give peace in Thy time, O Lord.


5. So shall Thy children in thankful devotion

Laud Him who saved them from peril abhorred,

Singing in chorus from ocean to ocean,

"Peace to the nations, and praise to the Lord.
