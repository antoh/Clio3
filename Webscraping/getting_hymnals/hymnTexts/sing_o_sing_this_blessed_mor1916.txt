Sing, O sing, this blessed morn,

Unto us a Child is born,

Unto us a Son is given,

God himself comes down from heaven;

Sing, O sing, this blessed morn,

Jesus Christ today is born.

God of God, and Light of Light,

Comes with mercies infinite,

Joining in a wondrous plan

Heaven to earth and God to man.

God with us, Emmanuel,

Deigns for ever now to dwell;

He on Adam's fallen race

Sheds the fullness of his grace.

God comes down that man may rise,

Lifted by him to the skies;

Christ is Son of man that we

Sons of God in him may be.

O renew us, Lord, we pray,

With thy Spirit day by day,

That we ever one may be

With the Father and with thee.

Amen.
