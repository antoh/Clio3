1 Searcher of hearts, from mine erase,

All thoughts that should not be,

And in its deep recesses trace

My gratitude to thee.


2 Hearer of prayer, O guide aright

Each word and deed of mine;

Life's battle teach me how to fight,

And be the vict'ry thine.


3 Giver of all--for ev'ry good

In the Redeemer came--

For raiment, shelter, and for food,

I thank thee in his Name.


4 Father and Son and Holy Ghost,

Thou glorious Three in One,

Thou knowest best what I need most,

And let thy will be done.
