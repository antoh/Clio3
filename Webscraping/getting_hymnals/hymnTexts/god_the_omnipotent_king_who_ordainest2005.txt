1 God the Omnipotent! King who ordainest

great winds thy clarion, lightnings thy sword:

show forth thy pity on high where thou reignest:

give to us peace in our time, O Lord.


2 God the All-merciful! earth hath forsaken

meekness and mercy, and slighted thy word;

bid not thy wrath in its terrors awaken;

give to us peace in our time, O Lord.


3 God, the All-righteous One! we have defied thee;

yet to eternity standeth thy word;

falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside thee;

give to us peace in our time, O Lord.


4 God the All-wise! by the fire of thy chastening,

earth shall to freedom and truth be restored;

through the thick darkness thy Kingdom is hastening;

thou wilt give peace in thy time, O Lord. 


5 So shall thy children, with thankful devotion,

praise him who saved them from peril and sword,

singing in chorus, from ocean to ocean,

peace to the nations, and praise to the Lord.
