O Love that casts out fear,

O Love that casts out sin,

Tarry no more without,

But come and dwell within!


True sunlight of the soul,

Surround us as we go;

So shall our way be safe,

Our feet no straying know.

Great love of God, come in!

Wellspring of heavenly peace;

Thou Living Water, come!

Spring up, and never cease.


Love of the living God,

Of Father and of Son;

Love of the Holy Ghost,

Fill thou each needy one.


Amen.
