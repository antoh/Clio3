1 Blessing and honor and glory and pow'r,

wisdom and and riches and strength evermore

give ye to him who our battle hath won,

whose are the kingdom, the crown, and the throne.


2 Into the heav'n of the heav'ns hath he gone,

sittest he now in the joy of the throne,

weareth he now of the kingdom the crown,

singeth he now the new song with his own.


3 Soundeth the heav'n of the heav'ns with his name,

ringeth the earth with his glory and fame,

ocean and mountains, stream, forest, and flow'r

echo his praises and tell of his pow'r.


3 Ever ascendeth the song and the joy;

ever descendeth the love from on high;

sing we the song of the Lamb that was slain,

dying in weakness and rising to reign.
