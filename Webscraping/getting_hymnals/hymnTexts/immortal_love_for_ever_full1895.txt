1 Immortal Love, for ever full,

For ever flowing free,

For ever shared, for ever whole,

A never-ebbing sea!


2 Our outward lips confess the Name

All other names above;

Love only knoweth whence it came,

And comprehendeth love.


3 We may not climb the heavenly steeps

To bring the Lord Christ down;

In vain we search the lowest deeps,

For Him no depths can drown:


4 But warm, sweet, tender, even yet

A present Help is He;

And faith has still its Olivet,

And love its Galilee.


5 The healing of His seamless dress

Is by our beds of pain;

We touch Him in life's throng and press,

And we are whole again.


6 Through Him the first fond prayers are said

Our lips of childhood frame;

The last low whispers of our dead

Are burdened with His Name.


7 O Lord, and Master of us all,

Whate'er our name or sign,

We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,

We test our lives by Thine.


Amen.
