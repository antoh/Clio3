1 All praise to Him Who built the hills;

All praise to Him the streams Who fills;

All praise to Him Who lights each star

That sparkles in the sky afar.


2 All praise to Him Who wakes the morn,

And bids it glow with beams new-born;

Who draws the shadows of the night,

Like curtains, o'er our wearied sight.


3 All praise to Him Whose love hath given,

In Christ His Son, the life of heaven;

Who gives us, for our darkness, light,

And turns to day our deepest night.


4 All praise to Him in love Who came,

To bear our woe, and sin, and shame;

Who lived to die, Who died to rise,

The all-prevailing the sacrifice.


5 All praise to Him Who sheds abroad

Within our hearts the love of God:

The Spirit of all truth and peace,

The fount of joy and holiness.


6 To Father, Son, and Spirit now

Our hands we lift, our knees we bow:

To Thee, blest Trinity, we raise

E'en here, in exile, songs of praise.


Amen.
