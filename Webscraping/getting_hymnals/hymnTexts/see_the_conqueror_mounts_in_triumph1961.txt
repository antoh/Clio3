See, the Conqu'ror mounts in triumph;

See the King in royal state,

Riding on the clouds, his chariot,

To his heav'nly palace gate:

Hark! the choirs of angel voices

Joyful Alleluias sing

And the portals high are lifted

To receive their heav'nly King.

Who is this that comes in glory,

With the trump of jubilee?

Lord of battles, God of armies,

He has gained the victory;

He who on the cross did suffer,

He who from the grave arose,

He has vanquished sin and Satan,

He by death has spoiled his foes.

Thou hast raised our human nature

In the clouds to God's right hand;

There we sit in heav'nly places,

There with thee in glory stand:

Jesus reigns, adored by angels,

Man with God is on the throne;

Mighty Lord, in thine ascension

We by faith behold our own.
