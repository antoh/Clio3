1 Glory be to God the Father,

Glory be to God the Son,

Glory be to God the Spirit:

Great Jehovah, Three in One!

Glory, glory

While eternal ages run!


2 Glory be to Him who loved us,

Washed us from each spot and stain:

Glory be to Him who bought us,

Made us kings with Him to reign!  

Glory, glory 

To the Lamb that once was slain!


3 Glory to the King of angels,

Glory to the Church's King,

Glory to the King of nations;

Heav'n and earth, your praises bring!

Glory, glory 

To the King of glory sing!


4 Glory, blessing, praise eternal!

Thus the choir of angels sings:

Honor, riches, pow'r, dominion!

Thus its praise creation brings.

Glory, glory, 

Glory to the King of kings!
