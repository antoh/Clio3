1.  Not what my hands have done 

can save my guilty soul;

Not what my toiling flesh has borne 

can make my spirit whole.

Not what I feel or do 

can give me peace with God;

Not all my prayers and sighs and tears 

can bear my awful load.


2.  Your voice alone, O Lord, 

can speak to me of grace;

Your pow'r alone, O Son of God, 

can all my sin erase.

No other work but Yours, 

no other blood will do;

No strength but that which is divine 

can bear me safely thro'.


3.  I praise the Christ of God; 

I rest on love divine;

And with unfalt'ring lip and heart 

I call this Savior mine.

My Lord has saved my life 

and freely pardon gives;

I love because he first loved me, 

I live because He lives.
