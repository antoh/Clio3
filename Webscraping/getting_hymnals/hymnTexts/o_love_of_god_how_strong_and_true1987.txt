PsH
1987
1 O love of God, how strong and true, 

eternal and yet ever new, 

uncomprehended and unbought, 

beyond all knowledge and all thought. 


2 O heavenly love, how precious still 

in days of weariness and ill, 

in nights of pain and helplessness, 

to heal, to comfort, and to bless. 


3 O wide-embracing, wondrous love! 

we read you in the sky above; 

we read you in the earth below, 

in seas that swell and streams that flow. 


4 We read you in the flowers, the trees, 

the freshness of the fragrant breeze, 

the song of birds upon the wing, 

the joy of summer and of spring. 


5 We read you best in him who came 

to bear for us the cross of shame, 

sent by the Father from on high, 

our life to live, our death to die. 


6 We read your power to bless and save 

e'en in the darkness of the grave; 

still more in resurrection light 

we read the fullness of your might. 


7 O love of God, our shield and stay 

through all the perils of our way; 

eternal love, in you we rest, 

forever safe, forever blest.
