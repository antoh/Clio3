1. A few more years shall roll,

A few more seasons come,

And we shall be with those that rest

Within their heav'nly home:

Then, O my Lord, prepare

My soul for that great day;

O wash me in Thy precious blood,

And take my sins away!


2. A few more storms shall beat

On this wild, rocky shore,

And we shall be where tempests cease,

And surges swell no more.

A few more struggles here,

A few more partings o'er,

A few more toils, a few more tears,

And we shall weep no more.


3. 'Tis but a little while

And He shall come again,

Who died that we might live, who lives

That we with Him may reign:

Then, O my Lord, prepare

My soul for that glad day;

O wash me in Thy precious blood,

And take my sins away!
