1 Lord, lead the way the Saviour went,

By lane and cell obscure,

And let love's treasures still be spent,

Like His, upon the poor:

Like Him, through scenes of deep distress,

Who bore the world's sad weight,

We, in their crowded loneliness,

Would seek the desolate.


2 For Thou hast placed us side by side,

In this wide world of ill,

And, that Thy followers may be tried,

The poor are with us still.

Mean are all offerings we can make.

But Thou hast taught us, Lord,

If given for the Saviour's sake,

They lose not their reward.
