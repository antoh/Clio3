1 When the weary, seeking rest,

To Thy goodness flee;

When the heavy-laden cast

All their load on Thee;

When the troubled, seeking peace,

On Thy Name shall call;

When the sinner, seeking life,

At Thy feet shall fall:

Hear then in love, O Lord, the cry

In heaven, Thy dwelling-place on high.


2 When the worldling, sick at heart,

Lifts his soul above;

When the prodigal looks back

To his Father's love;

When the proud man, in his pride,

Stoops to seek Thy face;

When the burdened brings his guilt

To Thy Throne of grace: 

Hear then in love, O Lord, the cry

In heaven, Thy dwelling-place on high.


3 When the stranger asks a home,

All his toils to end;

When the hungry craveth food,

And the poor a friend;

When the sailor on the wave,

Bows the fervent knee;

When the soldier on the field,

Lifts his heart to Thee:

Hear then in love, O Lord, the cry

In heaven, Thy dwelling-place on high.


4 When the man of toil and care

In the city crowd;

When the shepherd on the moor

Names the Name of God;

When the learn'd and the high,

Tired of earthly fame,

Upon higher joys intent,

Name the bless'd Name:

Hear then in love, O Lord, the cry

In heaven, Thy dwelling-place on high.


5 When the child, with grave fresh lip,

Youth or maiden fair;

When the aged, weak and gray,

Seek Thy face in prayer;

When the widow weeps to Thee,

Sad and lone and low;

When the orphan brings to Thee

All his orphan woe:

Hear then in love, O Lord, the cry

In heaven, Thy dwelling-place on high.


Amen.
