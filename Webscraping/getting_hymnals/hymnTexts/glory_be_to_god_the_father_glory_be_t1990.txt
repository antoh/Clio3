1 Glory be to God the Father,

glory be to God the Son,

glory be to God the Spirit:

Great Jehovah, Three in One!

Glory, glory while eternal ages run!


2 Glory be to him who loved us,

washed us from each spot and stain:

glory be to him who bought us,

now with God on high to reign!

Glory, glory to the Lamb that once was slain!


3 Glory to the King of angels,

glory to the church's King,

glory to the King of nations;

heaven and earth, your praises bring!

Glory, glory to the King of glory sing!


4 Glory, blessing, praise eternal!

Thus the choir of angels sings:

honor, riches, power, dominion!

Thus its praise creation brings.

Glory, glory, glory to the King of kings!
