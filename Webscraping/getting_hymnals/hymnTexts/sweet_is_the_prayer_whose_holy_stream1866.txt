Sweet is the prayer whose holy stream

In earnest pleading flows;

Devotion dwells upon the theme,

And warm and warmer glows.

Faith grasps the blessing she desires,

Hope points the upward gaze;

And love, untrembling love, inspires

The eloquence of praise.

But sweeter far the still, small voice,

Heard by no human ear,

When God hath made the heart rejoice,

And dried the bitter tear.

Nor accents flow, nor words ascend;

All utterance faileth there;

But listening spirits comprehend,

And God accepts the prayer.
