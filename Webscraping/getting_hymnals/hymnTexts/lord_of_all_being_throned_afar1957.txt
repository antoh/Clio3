1 Lord of all being, throned afar,

Thy glory flames from sun and star;

Center and soul of every sphere,

Yet to each loving heart how near!


2 Sun of our life, Thy quickening ray

Sheds on our path the glow of day;

Star of our hope, Thy softened light

Cheers the long watches of the night.


3 Our midnight is Thy smile withdrawn;

Our noontide is Thy gracious dawn;

Our rainbow arch, Thy mercy's sign;

All, save the cloud of sin, are Thine.


4 Grant us Thy truth to make us free,

And kindling hearts that burn for Thee;

Till all Thy living altars claim

One holy light, one heavenly flame. 


Amen.
