1 O Holy Ghost, Thou God of peace,

Pity Thy Church, now rent in twain;

Bid wrath, and strive, and variance cease,

And let us all be one again;


2 One with our brethren here in love,

And one with saints that are at rest,

And one with angel hosts above,

And one with God forever blest.


3 Oh, make on earth all churches one,

One with the blessed gone before,

All nit in sweet communion,

To love Thee, worship, and adore.


4 For one the Lord on Whom we call,

The Spirit one whom He hath given,

One God and Father of us all,

One Faith on earth, one Hope in heaven.


Amen.
