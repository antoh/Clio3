1 Songs of thankfulness and praise, 

Jesus, Lord, to you we raise, 

once revealed, when heaven's star

brought the wise men from afar;

Branch of royal David's stem

in your birth at Bethlehem, 

Word before the world began,

God revealed to us in man.


2 God revealed at Jordan's stream,

prophet, priest and king supreme, 

once revealed in power divine

changing water into wine:

Cana's holy wedding guest

keeping to the last the best,

Word before the world began,

God revealed to us in man.


3 God revealed in valiant fight,

conquering the devil's might,

sins forgiven, sickness healed,

life restored and God revealed:

once revealed in gracious will

ever bringing good from ill,

Word before the world began,

God revealed to us in man.


4 Stars shall fall and heavens fade,

sun and moon shall dark be made;

Christ will then like lightning shine,

all will see the glorious sign:

all will then the trumpet hear,

all will see the Son appear,

Word before the world began,

God revealed to us in man.
