1 Come, Thou Bright and Morning Star,

Light of light, without beginning!

Shine upon us from afar

That we may be kept from sinning.

Drive away by Thy clear light

Our dark night.


2 Let Thy grace, like morning dew

Falling soft on barren places,

Comfort, quicken, and renew

Our dry souls and dying graces;

Bless Thy flock from Thy rich store

Evermore.


3 May Thy fervent love destroy

Our cold works, in us awaking

Ardent zeal and holy joy

At the purple morn's first breaking.

Let us truly rise ere yet

Life has set.


4 Thou who hast gone up on high,

Grant that, when Thy trumpet soundeth,  

When with glory, in the sky,

Thee Thy cloud of saints surroundeth,

We may stand among Thine own,

Round Thy throne.


5 Light us to the golden shore

O Thou rising Sun of morning!

Lead where tears shall flow no more,

Where all sighs to songs are turning,

Where Thy glory sheds alway

Perfect day.
