1 The Lord ascendeth up on high,

the Lord hath triumphed gloriously,

in power and might excelling;

the grave and hell are captive led,

see him return, our glorious Head,

to his eternal dwelling.


2 The heavens with joy receive their Lord,

by saints, by angel hosts adored;

O day of exultation!

Come earth, adore thy glorious King!

His rising, his ascension sing

with grateful adoration!


3 Our great High Priest hath gone before,

now on his Church his grace to pour;

and still his love he giveth:

oh, may our hearts to him ascend;

may all within us upward tend

to him who ever liveth!
