PsH
1987
1 Crown him with many crowns, 

the Lamb upon his throne, 

while heaven's eternal anthem drowns 

all music but its own! 

Awake, my soul, and sing 

of him who died to be 

your Savior and your matchless King 

through all eternity. 


2 Crown him the Lord of life, 

triumphant o'er the grave, 

who rose victorious from the strife 

for those he came to save. 

His glories now we sing 

who died and reigns on high; 

he died, eternal life to bring, 

and lives that death may die. 


3 Crown him the Lord of peace; 

his kingdom is at hand. 

From pole to pole let warfare cease 

and Christ rule every land! 

All hail, Redeemer, hail, 

for you have died for me. 

Your praise shall never, never fail 

throughout eternity.
