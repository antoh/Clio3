1 Nearer, my God, to Thee,

Nearer to Thee!

E'en though it be a cross

That raiseth me;

Still all my song shall be,


Refrain

Nearer, my God, to Thee;

Nearer, my God, to Thee;

Nearer to Thee!


2 Though like the wanderer,

The sun gone down,

Darkness be over me,

My rest a stone;

Yet in my dreams I'd be Refrain


3 There let the way appear,

Steps unto heav'n:

All that Thou sendest me

In mercy giv'n:

Angels to beckon me Refrain


4 Then, with my waking tho'ts

Bright with Thy praise,

Out of my stony griefs

Bethel I'll raise;

So by my woes to be Refrain


5 Or if on joyful wing,

Cleaving the sky,

Sun, moon, and stars forgot,

Upward I'll fly,

Still all my song shall be, Refrain
