1 Out of the depths to thee I raise

the voice of lamentation;

Lord, turn a gracious ear to me,

and hear my supplication;

if thou shouldst be extreme to mark

each secret sin and misdeed dark,

O who could stand before Thee?


2 To wash away the crimson stain

grace, grace alone prevaileth;

our works, alas! are all in vain;

in much the best life faileth:

for none can glory in thy sight,

all must alike confess thy might

and live alone by mercy.


3 Therefore my trust is in the Lord,

and not in mine own merit;

on him my soul shall rest: his word

upholds my fainting spirit;

him promised mercy is my fort,

my comfort, and my strong support;

I wait for it with patience.


4 What though I wait the live-long night,

and till the dawn appeareth,

my heart still trusteth in his might;

it doubteth not nor feareth:

so let the Israelite in heart,

born of the Spirit, do his part,

and wait till God appeareth.
