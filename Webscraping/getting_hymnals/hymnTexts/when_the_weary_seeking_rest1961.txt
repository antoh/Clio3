When the weary, seeking rest,

To thy goodness flee;

When the heavy-laden cast

All their load on thee;

When the troubled, seeking peace,

On thy Name shall call;

When the sinner, seeking life,

At thy feet shall fall:

Hear then in love, O Lord, the cry

In heav'n, thy dwelling place on high.

When the stranger asks a home,

All his toils to end;

When the hungry craveth food,

And the poor a friend;

When the widow weeps to thee,

Sad and lone and low;

When the orphan brings to thee

All his orphan woe:

When the worldling, sick at heart,

Lifts his soul above;

When the prodigal looks back

To his Father's love;

When the proud man, in his pride,

Stoops to seek thy face;

When the burdened brings his guilt

To thy Throne of grace:
