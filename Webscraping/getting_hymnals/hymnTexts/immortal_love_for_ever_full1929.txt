1. Immortal Love, forever full,

Forever flowing free,

Forever shared, forever whole,

A never-ebbing sea!


2. We may not climb the heav'nly steeps

To bring the Lord Christ down;

In vain we search the lowest deeps,

For Him no depths can drown.


3. But warm, sweet, tender, even yet

A present help is He;

And faith has still its Olivet,

And love its Galilee.


4. The healing of His seamless dress

Is by our beds of pain;

We touch Him in life's throng and press,

And we are whole again.
