1 Gracious Savior, gentle Shepherd,

Children all are dear to Thee;

Gathered with Thine arms and carried

In Thy bosom may we be;

Sweetly, fondly, safely tended,

From all want and danger free.


2 Tender Shepherd, never leave us

From Thy fold to go astray;

By Thy look of love directed,

May we walk the narrow way.

Thus direct us and protect us, 

Lest they fall an easy prey.


3 Cleanse our hearts from sinful folly

In the stream Thy love supplied,

Mingled stream of blood and water

Flowing from Thy wounded side;

And to heav'nly pastures lead us,

Where Thine own still waters glide.


4 Let Thy holy Word instruct us;

Guide us daily by its light;

Let Thy love and grace constrain us

To approve whate'er is right,

Take Thine easy yoke and wear it,

Strengthened with Thy heav'nly might.


5 Taught to lisp Thy holy praises

Which on earth Thy children sing,

Both with lips and hearts unfeigned,

May we thank-off'rings bring,

Then with all the saints in glory

Join to praise our Lord and King.
