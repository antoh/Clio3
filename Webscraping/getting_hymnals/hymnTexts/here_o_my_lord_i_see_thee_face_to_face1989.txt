1.	Here, O my Lord, I see thee face to face; 

	here would I touch and handle things unseen; 

	here grasp with firmer hand eternal grace, 

	and all my weariness upon thee lean. 


2.	This is the hour of banquet and of song; 

	this is the heavenly table spread for me; 

	here let me feast, and feasting, still prolong

	the hallowed hour of fellowship with thee. 


3.	Here would I feed upon the bread of God, 

	here drink with thee the royal wine of heaven; 

	here would I lay aside each earthly load, 

	here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven. 


4.	Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear; 

	the feast, though not the love, is past and gone.

	The bread and wine remove; but thou art here, 

	nearer than ever, still my shield and sun. 


5.	Feast after feast thus comes and passes by; 

	yet, passing, points to the glad feast above, 

	giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy, 

	the Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love.
