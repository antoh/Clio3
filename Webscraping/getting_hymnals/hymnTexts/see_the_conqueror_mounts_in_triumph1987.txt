PsH
1987
1 See, the Conqueror mounts in triumph; 

see the King in royal state, 

riding on the clouds, his chariot, 

to his heavenly palace gate. 

Hark! the choirs of angel voices 

joyful alleluias sing, 

and the gates on high are opened 

to receive their heavenly King. 


2 He who on the cross did suffer, 

he who from the grave arose, 

he has vanquished sin and Satan, 

he by death has spoiled his foes. 

While he lifts his hands in blessing, 

he is parted from his friends. 

While their eager eyes behold him, 

in the cloud the Lord ascends. 


3 You have raised our human nature 

on the clouds to God's right hand; 

there we sit in heavenly places, 

there with you in glory stand. 

Jesus reigns, adored by angels; 

man with God is on the throne! 

Mighty Lord, in your ascension 

we by faith can see our own.
