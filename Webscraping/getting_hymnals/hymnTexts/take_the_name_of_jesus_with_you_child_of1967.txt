1 Take the name of Jesus with you,

Child of sorrow and of woe,;

It will joy and comfort give you,

Take it, then, where'er you go.


Chorus:

Precious name, O how sweet!

Hope of earth and joy of Heav'n;

Precious name, O how sweet!

Hope of earth and joy of Heav'n.


2 Take the name of Jesus ever,

As a shield from ev'ry snare;

If temptations round you gather,

Breathe that holy name in prayer. (Chorus)


3 O the precious name of Jesus!

How it thrills our souls with joy,

When His loving arms receive us,

And His songs our tongues employ! (Chorus)


4 At the name of Jesus bowing,

Falling prostrate at His feet,

King of kings in Heav'n we'll crown Him,

When our journey is complete. (Chorus)
