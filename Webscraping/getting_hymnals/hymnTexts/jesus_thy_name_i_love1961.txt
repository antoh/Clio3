Jesus, thy Name I love

All other names above,

Jesus, my Lord:

O thou art all to me;

Nothing to please I see,

Nothing apart from thee,

Jesus, my Lord.

Thou blessed Son of God,

Hast bought me with thy blood,

Jesus, my Lord:

O how great is thy love,

All other loves above,

Love that I daily prove,

Jesus, my Lord.

When unto thee I flee,

Thou wilt my refuge be,

Jesus, my Lord:

What need I now to fear,

What earthly grief or care,

Since thou art ever near?

Jesus, my Lord.

Soon thou wilt come again;

I shall be happy then,

Jesus, my Lord:

Then thine own face I'll see,

Then I shall like thee be,

Then evermore with thee,

Jesus, my Lord.
