1 Praise to the Holiest in the height,

and in the depth be praise, --

in all his words most wonderful,

most sure in all his ways.


2 O loving wisdom of our God!

when all was sin and shame,

a second Adam to the fight

and to the rescue came.


3 O wisest love! that flesh and blood,

which did in Adam fail,

should strive afresh against the foe,

should strive and should prevail.


4 O generous love! that he who smote

in Man, for man, the foe,

the double agony in Man

for man should undergo;


4 And in the garden secretly,

and on the Cross on high,

should teach his brethren, and inspire

to suffer and to die.


5 Praise to the Holiest in the height,

and in the depth be praise, --

in all his words most wonderful,

most sure in all his ways.
