1 O happy home, where Thou art loved the dearest,

Thou loving Friend and Savior of our race,

And where among the guests there never cometh

One who can hold such high and honored place.


2 O happy home, where each one serves thee, lowly,

Whatever his appointed work may be,

Till every common task seems great and holy,

When it is done, O Lord, as unto thee.


3 O happy home, where Thou art not forgotten

When joy is overflowing, full and free,

O happy home, where every wounded spirit

Is brought, Physician, Comforter, to Thee.


4 Until at last, when earth's day's work is ended,

All meet thee in the blessed home above,

From whence Thou camest, where Thou hast ascended,

Thine everlasting home of peace and love!


Amen.
