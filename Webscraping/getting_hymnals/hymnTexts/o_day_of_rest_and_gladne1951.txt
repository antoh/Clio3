1 O day of rest and gladness,

O day of joy and light,

O balm of care and sadness,

Most beautiful, most bright;

On thee the high and lowly,

Bending before the throne,

Sing, "Holy, Holy, Holy,"

To the great Three in One.


2 On thee at the creation

The light first had its birth;

On thee for our salvation

Christ rose from depths of earth;

On thee, our Lord, victorious,

The Spirit sent from heav'n;

And thus on thee, most glorious,

A threefold light is giv'n.


3 O day of sweet reflection,

Thou art a day of love;

O day of resurrection

From earth to things above,

When gospel light is glowing

With pure and radiant beams,

And living waters flowing

With soul refreshing streams.


4 New graces ever gaining

From this our day of rest,

We reach the rest  remaining

To spirits of the blest.

To Holy Ghost be praises,

To Father and to Son;

The Church her voice upraises

To Thee, blest Three in One.
