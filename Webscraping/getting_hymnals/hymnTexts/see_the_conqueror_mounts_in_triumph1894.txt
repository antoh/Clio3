1 See the Conqueror mounts in triumph;

See the King in royal state,

Riding on the clouds, His chariot,

To His heav'nly palace gate!

Hark! the choir of angel voices

Joyful alleluias sing,

And the portals high are lifted

To receive their heavenly King.


2 Who is this that comes in glory,

With the trump of jubilee?

Lord of battles, God of armies,

He hath gained the victory!

He Who on the cross did suffer,

He Who from the grave arose,

He has vanquished sin and Satan;

He by death has spoiled His foes.


3 While He raised His hands in blessing,

He was parted from His friends;

While their eager eyes behold Him,

He upon the clouds ascends;

He Who walked with God and pleased Him,

Preaching truth and doom to come,

He, our Enoch, is translated,

To His everlasting home.


4 Now our heavenly Aaron enters,

With His blood, within the veil;

Joshua now is come to Canaan,

And the kings before Him quail;

Now He plants the tribes of Israel

In their promised resting-place;

Now our great Elijah offers

Double portion of His grace.


5 Thou hast raised our human nature

On the clouds to God's right hand:

There we sit in heavenly places,

There with Thee in glory stand.

Jesus reigns, adored by angels;

Man with God is on the throne;

Mighty Lord, in Thine Ascension,

We by faith behold our own.


Amen.
