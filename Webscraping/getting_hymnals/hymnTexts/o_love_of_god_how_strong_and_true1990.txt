1 O love of God, how strong and true!

Eternal, and yet ever new;

Uncomprehended and unbought,

Beyond all knowledge and all thought.

O love of God, how deep and great!

Far deeper than man's deepest hate;

Self-fed, self-kindled like the light,

Changeless, eternal, infinite.


2 O heav'nly love, how precious still,

In days of weariness and ill,

In nights of pain and helplessness,

To heal, to comfort, and to bless!

O wide embracing, wondrous love!

We read you in the sky above,

We read you in the earth below,

In seas that swell, and streams that flow.


3 We read you best in him who came

To bear for us the cross of shame;

Sent by the Father from on high,

Our life to live, our death to die.

We read your power to bless and save,

Even in the darkness of the grave;

Still more in resurrection light

We read the fulness of thy might.


4 O love of God, our shield and stay

Through all the perils of our way!

Eternal love, in thee we rest,

For ever safe, for ever blest.

We will exalt you, God and King,

and we will ever prise your name;

we will extol yuo ev'ry day,

and evermore your praise proclaim.
