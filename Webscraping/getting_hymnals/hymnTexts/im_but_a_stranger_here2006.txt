1 I'm but a stranger here,

Heav'n is my home;

Earth is a desert drear,

Heav'n is my home.

Danger and sorrow stand

Round me on ev'ry hand;

Heav'n is my fatherland,

Heav'n is my home.


2 What though the tempest rage,

Heav'n is my home;

Short is my pilgrimage,

Heav'n is my home;

And time's wild wintry blast

Soon shall be overpast;

I shall reach home at last;

Heav'n is my home.


3 Therefore I murmur not,

Heav'n is my home;

Whate'er my earthly lot,

Heav'n is my home;

And I shall surely stand

There at my Lord's right hand;

Heav'n is my fatherland,

Heav'n is my home.
