1 O God, beneath Thy guiding hand

Our exiled fathers crossed the sea;

And when they trod the wintry strand,

With prayer and psalm they worshiped Thee.


2 Thou heard'st well pleased, the song, the prayer:

Thy blessing came; and still its power

Shall onward, through all ages, bear

The memory of that holy hour.


3 Laws, freedom, truth, and faith in God

Came with those exiles o'er the waves;

And where their pilgrim feet have trod,

The God they trusted guards their graves.


4 And here Thy Name, O God of love,

Their children's children shall adore,

Till these eternal hills remove,

And spring adorns the earth no more.


Amen.
