1 Songs of thankfulness and praise, 

Jesus, Lord, to thee we raise, 

manifested by the star

to the sages from afar;

branch of royal David's stem

in thy birth at Bethlehem, 

anthems be to thee addressed,

word in flesh made manifest.


2 Manifest at Jordan's stream,

Prophet, Priest and King supreme,

and at Cana, wedding guest

in thy Godhead manifest.

manifest in pow'r divine,

changing water into wine,

anthems be to thee addressed,

God on earth made manifest.


3 Manifest in making whole

palsied limbs an fainting soul,

manifest in valiant fight,

quelling all the devil's might.

manifest in gracious will, 

ever bringing good from ill.

anthems be to thee addressed,

God for us made manifest.


4 Grant us grace to see thee, Lord,

mirrored in thy holy Word;

may we imitate thee now,

and be pure, as pure art thou,

that we like to thee may be

at thy great epiphany,

and may praise thee, ever blest,

God for all made manifest.
