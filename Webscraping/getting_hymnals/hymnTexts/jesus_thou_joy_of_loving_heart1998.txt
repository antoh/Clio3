1 Jesus, the joy of loving hearts,

true source of life, our lives sustain;

from the best bliss that earth imparts,

we turn unfilled to you again.


2 Your truth unchanged has ever stood;

you rescue those who on you call:

to those yet seeking, you are good;

to those who find you, all in all.


3 We taste of you, the living bread,

and long to feast upon you still.

We drink from you, the fountain-head,

our thirsty souls from you we fill.


4 Our restless spirits long for you,

however may our lot be cast,

glad when your gracious smile we view,

blessed when our faith can hold you fast.


5 Jesus, forever with us stay:

make all our moments calm and bright;

chase the dark night of sin away;

shed through the world your holy light.
