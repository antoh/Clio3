Go, labor on: spend, and be spent,

Thy joy to do the Father's will;

It is the way the Master went;

Should not the servant tread it still?

Go, labor on: 'tis not for naught;

Thine earthly loss is heav'nly gain;

Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not;

The Master praises-what are men?

Go, labor on: enough while here

If he shall praise thee, if he deign

Thy willing heart to mark and cheer:

No toil for him shall be in vain.

Go, labor on while it is day:

The world's dark night is hast'ning on.

Speed, speed thy work, cast sloth away;

It is not thus that souls are won.

Toil on, faint not, keep watch and pray;

Be wise the erring soul to win;

Go forth into the world's highway,

Compel the wand'rer to come in.

Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice;

For toil comes rest, for exile home;

Soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom's voice,

The midnight peal, "Behold, I come."
