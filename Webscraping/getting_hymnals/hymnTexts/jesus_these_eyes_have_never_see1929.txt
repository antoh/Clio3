1. Jesus, these eyes have never seen

That radiant form of Thine;

The veil of sense hangs dark between

Thy blessed face and mine.


2. I see Thee not, I hear Thee not,

Yet art Thou oft with me;

And earth hath ne'er so dear a spot

As where I meet with Thee.


3. Yet though I have not seen, and still

Must rest in faith alone,

I love Thee, dearest Lord,--and will,

Unseen, but not unknown.


4. When death these mortal eyes shall seal,

And still this throbbing heart,

The rending veil shall Thee reveal,

All glorious as Thou art.
