Through all this life&#8217;s eventful road,

Fain would I walk with Thee, my God,

And make Thy presence light around,

And every step on holy ground.

Each blessing would I trace to Thee,

In every grief Thy mercy see;

And through the paths of duty move,

Conscious of Thine encircling love.

And when the angel Death stands by,

Be this my strength, that Thou art nigh;

And this my joy, that I shall be

With those who dwell in light with Thee.
