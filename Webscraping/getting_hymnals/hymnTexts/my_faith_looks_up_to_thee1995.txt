1 My faith looks up to thee, 

thou Lamb of Calvary, 

Savior divine! 

Now hear me while I pray;

take all my guilt away;

oh, let me from this day 

be wholly thine.


2 May thy rich grace impart 

strength to my fainting heart, 

my zeal inspire; 

as thou hast died for me, 

oh, may my love to thee 

pure, warm, and changeless be, 

a living fire.


3 While life's dark maze I tread,

and griefs around me spread, 

be thou my guide; 

bid darkness turn to day, 

wipe sorrow's tears away, 

nor let me ever stray 

from thee aside.
