1 Thy works, not mine, O Christ,

Speak gladness to this heart;

They tell me all is done,

They bid my fear depart.


Refrain:

To whom, save Thee,

Who canst alone

For sin atone,

Lord, shall I flee?


2 Thy pains, not mine, O Christ,

Can heal my bruised soul;

Thy stripes, not mine, contain

The balm that makes me whole. [Refrain]


3 Thy cross, not mine, O Christ,

Has borne the crushing load

Of sins that none could bear

But the incarnate God. [Refrain]


4 Thy death, not mine, O Christ,

Has paid the ransom due;

Ten thousand deaths like mine

Would have been all too few. [Refrain]


5 Thy righteousness, O Christ,

Alone can cover me;

No righteousness avails

Save that which is of Thee. [Refrain]
