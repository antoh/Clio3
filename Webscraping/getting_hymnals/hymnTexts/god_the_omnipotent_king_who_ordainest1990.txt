1 God the Omnipotent! King, who ordainest

thunder thy clarion, the lightning thy sword,

show forth thy pity on high where thou reignest:

give to us peace in our time, O Lord.


2 God the All-merciful! Earth hath forsaken

thy ways all holy, and slighted thy word;

bid not thy wrath in its terrors awaken:

give to us peace in our time, O Lord.


3 God the All-righteous One! Earth hath defied thee,

Yyt to eternity standeth thy word;

falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside thee;

give to us peace in our time, O Lord.


4 So shall thy people, with thankful devotion,

praise him who saved them from peril and sword,

singing in chorus from ocean to ocean,

"Peace to the nations, and praise to the Lord."



 fire of thy chastening,

Earth shall to freedom and truth be restored;

Through the thick darkness thy kingdom is hast'ning;

Thou wilt give peace in thy time, O Lord.
