PsH
1987
1 Fill thou my life, O Lord, my God, 

in every part with praise, 

that my whole being may proclaim 

thy being and thy ways. 

Not for the lip of praise alone, 

nor e'en the praising heart 

I ask, but for a life made up 

of praise in every part. 


2 Praise in the common words I speak, 

life's common looks and tones, 

in fellowship enjoyed at home 

with my beloved ones, 

enduring wrong, reproach, or loss 

with sweet and steadfast will, 

forgiving freely those who hate, 

returning good for ill. 


3 So shall each fear, each fret, each care 

be turned into a song, 

and every winding of the way 

the echo shall prolong. 

So shall no part of day or night 

from sacredness be free, 

but all my life, in every step, 

be fellowship with thee.
