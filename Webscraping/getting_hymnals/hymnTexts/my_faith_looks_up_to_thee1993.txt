1 My faith looks up to thee,

Thou lamb of Calvary,

Savior divine!

Now hear me while I pray,

Take all my guilt away;

O let me from this day

Be wholly thine.

2 May thy rich grace impart

Strength to my fainting heart,

My zeal inspire;

As thou hast died for me,

O may my love to thee

Pure, warm, and changeless be

A living fire.

3 While life's dark maze I tread,

And griefs around me spread,

Be thou my guide;

Bid darkness turn today,

Wipe sorrow's tears away;

Pure, warm, and changeless be

A living fire.

4 When ends life's transient dream,

When death's cold, sullen stream

Shall o'er me roll;

Blest Savior, then in love,

Fear and distrust remove,

O bear me safe above,

A ransomed soul.
