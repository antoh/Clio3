1 Songs of thankfulness and praise,

Jesus, Lord, to thee we raise,

Manifested by the star

To the sages from afar,

Branch of royal David's stem

In Thy birth at Bethlehem:

Anthems be to Thee addressed,

God in man made manifest.


2 Manifest at Jordan's stream,

Prophet, Priest, and King supreme;

And at Cana wedding guest

In the God-head manifest;

Manifest in pow'r divine,

Changing water into wine;

Anthems be to Thee addressed,

God in man made manifest.


3 Manifest in making whole 

Palsied limbs and fainting soul;

Manifest in valiant fight,

Quelling all the devil's might;

Manifest in gracious will,

Ever bringing good from ill;

Anthems be to Thee addressed,

God in man made manifest.


4 Sun and moon shall darkened be,

Stars shall fall, the heav'ns shall flee;

Christ will then like lightning shine,

All will see His glorious sign;

All will then the trumpet hear,

All will see the Judge appear;

Thou by all wilt be confessed,

God in man made manifest.


5 Grant us grace to see Thee, Lord,

Present in Thy holy Word--

Grace to imitate Thee now

And be pure, as pure art Thou;

That we might become like Thee

At Thy great epiphany

And may praise Thee, ever blest,

God in man made manifest.
