1 Great King of nations, hear our prayer,

While at your feet we fall,

And humbly, with united cry,

To you for mercy call.


2 The guilt is ours, but grace is yours,

O turn us not away;

But hear us from your lofty throne,

And help us when we pray.


3 Our fathers' sins were manifold,

And ours no less we own,

Yet wondrously from age to age

Your goodness has been shown.


4 When dangers, like a stormy sea,

Beset our country round,

To you we looked, to you we cried,

And help in you was found.


5 With one consent we meekly bow

Beneath thy chast'ning hand,

And, pouring forth confession meet,

Mourn with our mourning land.


6 With pitying eye behold our need,

As thus we lift our prayer;

Correct us with your judgments, Lord,

Then let your mercy spare.
