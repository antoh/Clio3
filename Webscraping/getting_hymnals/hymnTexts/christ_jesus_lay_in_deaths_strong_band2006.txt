1 Christ Jesus lay in death's strong bands,

For our offenses given;

But now at God's right hand He stands

And brings us life from heaven.

Therefore let us joyful be

And sing to God right thankfully

Loud songs of allelujah!

Allelujah!


2 No son of man could conquer death,

Such mischief sin had wrought us,

No innocence was found on earth,

And therefore death had brought us

Into bondage from of old

And ever grew more strong and bold

And held us as its captive.

Alleluia!


3 Christ Jesus, God's own Son, came down

His people to deliver;

Destroying sin, He took the crown

From death's pale brow forever:

Stripped of pow'r, no more it reigns;

An empty form alone remains;

Its sting is lost forever.

Allelia!


4 It was a strange and dreadful strife

When life and death contended.

The victory remained with life,

The reign of death was ended.

Holy Scripture plainly saith

Its sting is lost forever.

Allelujah!


5 Here the true Paschal Lamb we see,

Whom God so freely gave us;

He died on the accursed tree--

So strong His love--to save us.

See, His blood now marks our door;

Faith points to it; death passes o'er,

And Satan cannot harm us.

Allelujah!


6 So let us keep the festival

Whereto the Lord invites us;

Christ is Himself the Joy of all,

Now His grace to us imparts

Eternal sunshine to our hearts;

The night of sin is ended.

Allelujah!


7 Then let us feast this Easter Day

On Christ, the bread of heaven;

The Word of grace has purged away

The old and evil leaven.

Christ alone our souls will feed,

He is our meat and drink indeed;

Faith lives upon no other!

Allelujah!
