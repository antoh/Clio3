1 I heard the voice of Jesus say,

'Come unto me and rest;

lay down, thou weary one, lay down

thy head upon my breast':

I came to Jesus as I was,

so weary, worn, and sad;

I found in him a resting-place, 

and he has made me glad.


2 I heard the voice of Jesus say,

'Behold, I freely give

the living water; thirsty one,

stoop down and drink, and live':

I came to Jesus, and I drank

of that life-giving stream;

my thirst was quenched, my soul revived,

and now I live in him.


3 I heard the voice of Jesus say,

'I am this dark world's Light;

Look unto me, thy morn shall rise,

and all thy day be bright':

I looked to Jesus, and I found 

in him my Star, my Sun;

and in that light of life I'll walk

till travelling days are done.
