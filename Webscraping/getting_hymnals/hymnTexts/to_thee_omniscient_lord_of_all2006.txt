1 To Thee, omniscient Lord of all,

In grief and shame I humbly call;

I see my sins against Thee, Lord,

The sins of thought and deed and word.

They press me sore; I cry to Thee:

O God, be merciful to me!


2 My Lord, my God, to Thee I pray;

O cast me not in wrath away!

Let Thy good Spirit ne'er depart,

But let Him draw to Thee my heart

That truly penitent I be:

O God, be merciful to me!


3 O Jesus, let Thy precious blood

Be to my soul a cleansing flood.

Turn not, O Lord, Thy guest away, 

But grant that justified I may 

Go to my house, at peace with Thee:

O God, be merciful to me!
