1 Christ is our cornerstone,

On Him alone we build;

With His true saints alone

The courts of heav'n are filled.

On His great love 

Our hopes we place

Of present grace 

And joys above.


2 Here may we gain from heav'n

The grace which we implore,

And may that grace, once giv'n,

Be with us evermore

Until that day 

When all the blest

To endless rest 

Are called away.


3 Oh, then, with hymns of praise

These hallowed courts shall ring;

Our voices we will raise

The Three in One to sing

And thus proclaim 

In joyful song,

Both loud and long, 

That glorious name.
