1 Immortal Love, forever full,

forever flowing free,

forever shared, forever whole,

a never ebbing sea.


2 Our outward lips confess the name

all other names above;

love only knoweth whence it came,

and comprehendeth love.


3 We may not climb the heav'nly steeps

to bring the Lord Christ down;

in vain we search the lowest deeps,

for him no depths can drown.


4 But warm, sweet, tender, even yet

a present help is he;

and faith has still its Olivet,

and love its Galilee.


5 The healing of his seamless dress

is by our beds of pain;

we touch him in life's throng and press,

and we are whole again.


6 Alone, O love ineffable,

thy saving name is given;

to turn aside from thee is hell;

to walk with thee is heaven.
