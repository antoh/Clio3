1 God the Father, be our Stay;

O let us perish never!

Cleanse us from our sins, we pray,

And grant us life forever.

Keep us from the evil one;

Uphold our faith most holy;

Grant us to trust Thee solely

With humble hearts and lowly.

Let us put God's armor on,

With all true Christian running

Our heav'nly race and shunning

The devil's wiles and cunning

Amen, amen! This be done;

So sing we, Alleluia!
