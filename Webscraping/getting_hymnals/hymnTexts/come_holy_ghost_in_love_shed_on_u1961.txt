Come, Holy Ghost, in love

Shed on us from above

Thine own bright ray:

Divinely good thou art;

Thy sacred gifts impart

To gladden each sad heart:

O come today.

Come, tend'rest Friend and best,

Our most delightful Guest,

With soothing pow'r:

Rest, which thy weary know;

Shade, 'mid the noontide glow;

Peace, when deep griefs o'erflow,

Cheer us this hour.

Come, Light serene, and still

Our inmost bosoms fill;

Dwell in each breast:

We know no dawn but thine;

Send forth thy beams divine

On our dark souls to shine,

And make us blest.

Exalt our low desires;

Extinguish passion's fires;

His praise employ;

Give virtue's rich reward;

Victorious death accord,

And, with our glorious Lord,

Eternal joy.
