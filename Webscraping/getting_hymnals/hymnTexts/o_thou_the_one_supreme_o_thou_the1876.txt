1.

O Thou, the One Supreme,

O thou, the deathless King,

Be Thou my only theme:

Grant me Thyself to sing.

To Thee the hymn, to Thee the praise,

Celestial choirs for ever raise.


2.

For Thee the ages run

In order as was given;

For Thee shines forth the sun,

The day-born eye of heaven:

For Thee the moon, and grand array

Of stars, hold on their nightly way.


3.


With reasonable soul

For Thee learns favoured man

His passions to control,

And the Divine to scan;

For Thou of all Creator art,

Thou madst the whole and every part.


4.

All march in ordered band:

O'er all Thou hold'st the reins:

All creatures of Thy hand

Thy Providence sustains.

For Thou the word didst speak--'twas done--

That Word of Thine is God the Son.


5.

For of same honour He,

Thine own begotten Son,

In form and quality

With Thee the Father one:

Who placed all things in harmony,

That over all He King might be.


6.


And all Thy works infolding

In bonds of love and truth,

The Spirit all-upholding,

Renews creation's youth

Foreseeing, He for all provides,

And Guardian over all presides.


7.

Thee, Thee, the Triune King,

The One Eternal Lord,

Thee evermore I'll sing,

By earth and heaven adored,

The Three in One, the One in Three,

The ever-living Trinity.


8.

Immovable of mind,

Of ways past mortal ken,

The boundless, undefined,

Wisdom's deep origin,

Upholder of the heavenly towers,

Ruler of all created powers.


9.


Beginning none, nor end:

The self-sprung Light art Thou:

We cannot comprehend,

But to Thy Brightness bow,

Whose eye, repelling mortal gaze,

All things above, below, surveys.


10.

Unseen, yet ever near,

Father, propitious be:

This my petition hear,

This boon accord to me:

That Light to serve through endless day,

And have my sins all washed away;


11.

That I, with conscience clear

From every evil thought,

May love with filial fear,

And worship as I ought,

Pure holy hands and heart upraising,

And Christ the Lord for ever praising.


12.


To Thee I bend the knee;

When He shall come, grant me,

That I His glory see,

That I His servant be:

When He shall come--shall come again;

When He shall come--shall come to reign.


13.

Father, propitious be!

On me Thy mercy show!

Bow down Thine ear to me,

On me Thy grace bestow;

For Thine the glory, Thine the grace,

While countless ages run their race.
