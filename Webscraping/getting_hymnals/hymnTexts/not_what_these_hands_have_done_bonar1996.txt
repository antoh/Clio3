1 Not what these hands have done

Can save this guilty soul;

Not what this toiling flesh has borne

Can make my spirit whole.

Not what I feel or do

Can give me peace with God;

Not all my prayers and sighs and tears

Can bear my awe-full load.


2 Thy work alone, O Christ,

Can ease this weight of sin;

Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God,

Can give me peace within.

Thy love to me, O God,

Not mine, O Lord to Thee,

Can rid me of this dark unrest

And set my spirit free.


3 Thy grace alone, O God,

To me can pardon speak;

Thy pow'r alone, O Son of God,

Can this sore bondage break.

I bless the Christ of God,

I rest on love divine,

By God's free gift of saving faith

I call this Savior mine.
