O Source divine, and Life of all,

The Fount of being&#8217;s wondrous sea!

Thy depth would every heart appall,

That saw not Love supreme in Thee.

We shrink before Thy vast abyss,

Where worlds on worlds eternal brood;

We know Thee truly but in this,

That Thou bestowest all our good.

And so, &#8217;mid boundless time and space,

O, grant us still in Thee to dwell,

And through the ceaseless web to trace

Thy presence working all things well!

Nor let Thou life&#8217;s delightful play

Thy truth&#8217;s transcendent vision hide;

Nor strength and gladness lead astray

From Thee, our nature&#8217;s only guide.

Bestow on every joyous thrill

Thy deeper tone of reverent awe;

Make pure Thy children&#8217;s erring will,

And teach their hearts to love Thy law!
