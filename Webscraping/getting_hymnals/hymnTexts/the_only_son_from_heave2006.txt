1 The only Son from heaven,

Foretold by ancient seers,

By God the Father given,

In human form appears.

No sphere His light confining,

No star so brightly shining

As He, our Morning Star.


2 O time of God appointed,

O bright and holy morn!

He comes, the King anointed,

The Christ, the virgin-born,

Grim death to vanquish for us,

To open heav'n before us

And bring us life again.


3 O Lord, our hearts awaken

To know and love You more,

In faith to stand unshaken,

In Spirit to adore,

That we, through this world moving,

Each glimpse of heaven proving,

May reap its fullness there.


4 O Father, here before You

With God the Holy Ghost

And Jesus, we adore You,

O pride of angel host:

Before You mortals lowly

Cry, "Holy, holy, holy,

O blessed Trinity!"
