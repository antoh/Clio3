We would leave, O God, to Thee,

Every anxious care and fear;

Thou the troubled thought canst see,

Thou canst dry the bitter tear.

Thou dost care for us, we know,&#8212;

Care with all a Father&#8217;s love;

Thou canst make each earthly woe

Work to higher bliss above.

On this faith we fain would rest;

Strengthen Thou its blessed power!

Steadfast keep it in our breast,

Through each dark and trying hour.
