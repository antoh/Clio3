1 O Bread to pilgrims given,

O Food that angels eat,

O Manna sent from heaven,

For heaven-born natures meet,

Give us, for Thee long pining,

To eat till richly filled;

Till, earth's delights resigning,

Our every wish is stilled.


2 O Water, life-bestowing,

Forth from the Saviour's heart,

A fountain purely flowing,

A fount of love Thou art:

O let us, freely tasting,

Our burning thirst assuage;

Thy sweetness, never wasting,

Avails from age to age.


3 Jesus, this feast receiving,

We Thee unseen adore;

Thy faithful word believing,

We take and doubt no more:

Give us, Thou True and Loving,

On earth to live in Thee;

Then, death the veil removing,

Thy glorious face to see.


Amen.
