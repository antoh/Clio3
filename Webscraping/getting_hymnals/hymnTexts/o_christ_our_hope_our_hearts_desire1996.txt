1 O Christ, our hope, our hearts' desire, 

Redemption's only spring!

Creator of the world art Thou, 

Its Savior and its King,

Its Savior and its King. 


2 How vast the mercy and the love 

Which laid our sins on Thee, 

And led Thee to a cruel death 

To set Thy people free,

To set Thy people free!


3 But now the bands of death are burst, 

The ransom has been paid! 

And Thou art on Thy Father's throne,

In glorious robes arrayed, 

In glorious robes arrayed. 


4 O may Thy mighty love prevail

Our sinful souls to spare!

O may we come before thy throne

And find acceptance there,

And find acceptance there!


5 O Christ, be Thou our lasting joy, 

Our future great reward; 

Our only glory may it be 

To glory in the Lord,

To glory in the Lord!
