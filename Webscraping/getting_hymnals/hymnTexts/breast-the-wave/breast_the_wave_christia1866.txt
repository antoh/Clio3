Breast the wave, Christian! when it is strongest;

Watch for day, Christian! when the night&#8217;s longest;

Onward and onward still be thine endeavor;

The rest that remaineth will be forever.

Fight the fight, Christian! Jesus is o&#8217;er thee;

Run the race, Christian! heaven is before thee;

He who hath promised faltereth never;

The love of eternity flows on forever.

Lift the eye, Christian! just as it closeth;

Raise the heart, Christian! ere it reposeth;

Thee from the love of Christ nothing shall sever;

Mount when the work is done,&#8212;praise God forever!
