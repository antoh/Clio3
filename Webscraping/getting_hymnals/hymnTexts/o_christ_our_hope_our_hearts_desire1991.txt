1.  O Christ, our hope, our heart's desire,

Redemption's only spring,

Creator of the world art Thou,

Its Savior and its King.


2.  How vast the mercy and the love

Which laid our sins on Thee;

And led Thee to a cruel death

To set Thy people free.


3.  But now the bonds of death are burst,

The ransom has been paid;

And Thou are on Thy Father's throne,

In glorious robes arrayed.


4.  O Christ, be Thou our lasting joy,

Our ever great reward;

Our only glory may it be

To glory in the Lord!
