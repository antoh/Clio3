Jerusalem! high tower thy glorious walls,

Would God I were in thee!

Desire of thee my longing heart enthralls,

Desire at home to be:

Wide from the world outleaping,

O'er hill, and vale, and plain,

My soul's strong wing is sweeping,

Thy portals to attain.


O gladsome day and yet more gladsome hour!

When shall that hour have come,

When my rejoicing soul its own free power

May use in going home?

Itself to Jesus giving

In trust to his own hand,

To dwell among the living

In that blest Fatherland.


Great fastness thou of honour! thee I greet:

Throw wide thy gracious gate,

An entrance free to give these longing feet,

At last released, though late,

From wretchedness and sinning,

And life's long, weary way;

And now, of God's gift, winning

Eternity's bright day.


Unnumbered choirs before the Lamb's high throne

There shout the jubilee,

With loud resounding peal and sweetest tone,

In blissful ecstasy:

505

A hundred thousand voices

Take up the wondrous song;

Eternity rejoices

God's praises to prolong.
