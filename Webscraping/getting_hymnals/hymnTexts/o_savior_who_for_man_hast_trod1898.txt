1 O Saviour, Who for man hast trod

The winepress of the wrath of God,

Ascend, and claim again on high

Thy glory, left for us to die.


2 A radiant cloud is now Thy seat,

And earth lies stretched beneath Thy feet;

Ten thousand thousands round Thee sing,

And share the triumph of their King.


3 The angel-host enraptured waits:

"Lift up your heads, eternal gates!"

O God and Man! the Father's throne

Is now for evermore Thine own.


4 Our great High-Priest and Shepherd, Thou

Within the veil art entered now,

To offer there Thy precious blood

Once poured on earth, a cleansing flood.


5 And thence the Church, Thy chosen bride,

With countless gifts of grace supplied,

Through all her members draws from Thee

Her hidden life of sanctity.


6 O Christ our Lord, of Thy dear care

Thy lowly members heaven-ward bear;

Be ours with Thee to suffer pain,

With Thee for evermore to reign.


Amen.
