No, not despairingly

Come I to thee;

No, not distrustingly

Bend I the knee:

Sin hath gone over me,

Yet is this still my plea,

Jesus hath died.

Lord, I confess to thee

Sadly my sin;

All am tell I thee,

All I have been:

Purge thou my sin away,

Wash thou my soul this day;

Lord, make my clean.

Faithful and just art thou,

Forgiving all;

Loving and kind art thou

When poor ones call:

Lord, let the cleansing blood,

Blood of the Lamb of God,

Pass o'er my soul.

Then all is peace and light

This soul within;

Thus shall I walk with thee,

The loved Unseen;

Leaning on thee, my God,

Guided along the road,

Nothing between.
