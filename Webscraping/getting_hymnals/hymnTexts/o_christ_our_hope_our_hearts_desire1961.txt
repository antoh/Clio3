O Christ, our hope, our heart's desire,

Redemption's only spring!

Creator of the world art thou,

Its Saviour and its King.

How vast the mercy and the love

Which laid our sins on thee,

And led thee to a cruel death,

To set thy people free.

But now the bands of death are burst,

The ransom has been paid;

And thou art on thy Father's throne,

In glorious robes arrayed.

O Christ, be thou our lasting joy,

Our ever great reward!

Our only glory may it be

To glory in the Lord.
