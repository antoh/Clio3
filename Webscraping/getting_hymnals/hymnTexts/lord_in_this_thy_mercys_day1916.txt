1916
Lord, in this thy mercy's day,

Ere the time shall pass away

On our knees we fall and pray.


Holy Jesus, grant us tears,

Fill us with heart-searching fears,

Ere that day of doom appears.


Lord, on us thy Spirit pour,

Kneeling lowly at thy door,

Ere it close for evermore.


By thy night of agony,

By thy supplicating cry,

By thy willingness to die,


By thy tears of bitter woe

For Jerusalem below,

Let us not thy love forego.


Judge and Savior of our race,

Grant us, when we see thy face,

With thy ransomed ones a place.


On thy love we rest alone

And that love shall then be known

By the pardoned, round thy throne.


Amen.
