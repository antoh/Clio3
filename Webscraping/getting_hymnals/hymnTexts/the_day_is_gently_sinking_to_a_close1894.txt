1 The day is gently sinking to a close,

Fainter and yet more faint the sunlight glows:

O Brightness of Thy Father's glory, Thou

Eternal Light of Light, be with us now:

Where Thou art present darkness cannot be;

Midnight is glorious noon, O Lord, with Thee.


2 Our changeful lives are ebbing to an end:

Onward to darkness and to death we tend:

O Conqueror of the grave, be Thou our guide,

Be Thou our light in death's dark eventide;

Then in our mortal hour will be no gloom,

No sting in death, no terror in the tomb.


3 Thou, Who in darkness walking didst appear

Upon the waves, and Thy disciples cheer;

Come, Lord, in lonesome days, when storms assail,

And earthly hopes and human succors fail:

When all is dark may we behold Thee nigh,

And hear Thy voice -- "Fear not, for it is I."


4 The weary world is mouldering to decay,

Its glories wane, its pageants fade away;

In that last sunset when the stars shall fall,

May we arise awakened by Thy call,

With Thee, O Lord, forever to abide

In that blest day which has no eventide.


Amen.
