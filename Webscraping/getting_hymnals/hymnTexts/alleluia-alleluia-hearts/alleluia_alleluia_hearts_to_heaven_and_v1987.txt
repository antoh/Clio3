1 Alleluia, alleluia! 

Hearts to heaven and voices raise. 

Sing to God a hymn of gladness, 

sing to God a hymn of praise. 

He who on the cross a victim 

for the world's salvation bled, 

Jesus Christ, the King of glory, 

now is risen from the dead. 


 Alleluia, Christ is risen! 

Death at last has met defeat. 

See the ancient powers of evil 

in confusion and retreat. 

Once he died and once was buried; 

now he lives forevermore  

Jesus Christ, the world's Redeemer, 

whom we worship and adore. 


 Christ is risen, Christ the firstfruits 

of the holy harvest field, 

which will all its full abundance 

at his second coming yield. 

Then the golden ears of harvest 

will their heads before him wave, 

ripened by his glorious sunshine 

from the furrows of the grave. 


4 Alleluia, alleluia! 

Glory be to God on high; 

alleluia! to the Savior, 

who has won the victory; 

alleluia! to the Spirit, 

fount of love and sanctity: 

alleluia, alleluia! 

to the triune Majesty.
