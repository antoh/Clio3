1 Alleluia, alleluia! 

Hearts to heaven and voices raise: 

sing to God a hymn of gladness, 

sing to God a hymn of praise; 

he who on the cross a victim 

for the world's salvation bled, 

Jesus Christ, the King of glory, 

now is risen from the dead. 


 Alleluia, Christ is risen! 

Death at last has met defeat: 

see the ancient powers of evil 

in confusion and retreat:

once he died, and once was buried: 

now he lives forevermore,  

Jesus Christ the world's Redeemer, 

 whom we worship and adore. 


 Christ is risen, we are risen!

Set your hearts on things above:

there in all the Father's glory

lives and reigns our King of love;

hear the word of peace he brings us,

see his wounded hands and side;

now let every wrong be ended,

every sin be crucified. 


 Alleluia, alleluia! 

Glory be to God on high! 

Alleluia to the Savior 

who has gained the victory! 

Alleluia to the Spirit, 

fount of love and sanctity!

Alleluia, alleluia! 

to the Triune Majesty!
