1 Alleluia! Alleluia! 

Hearts to heaven and voices raise;

Sing to God a hymn of gladness,

Sing to God a hymn of praise:

He who on the cross a Victim

For the world's salvation bled,

Jesus Christ, the King of Glory,

Now is risen from the dead.


 Christ is risen, Christ the first-fruits

Of the holy harvest-field,

Which will all its full abundance

At His second coming yield:

Then the golden ears of harvest

Will their heads before Him wave,

Ripened by His glorious sunshine

From the furrows of the grave.


 Christ is risen; we are risen.

Shed upon us heavenly grace,

Rain and dew and gleams of glory

From the brightness of Thy face;

That we, Lord, with hearts in heaven,

Here on earth may fruitful be,

And by angel-hands be gathered,

And be ever safe with Thee.


4 Alleluia! Alleluia!

Glory be to God in high;

To the Father and the Saviour

Who has gained the victory;

Glory to the Holy Spirit,

Fount of love and sanctity;

Alleluia! Alleluia!

To the Triune majesty.


Amen.
