1 Hark! the sound of holy voices,

Chanting at the crystal sea,

Alleluia, alleluia,

Alleluia, Lord, to Thee;

Multitude which none can number,

Like the stars in glory stands,

Clothed in white apparel, holding

Palms of victory in their hands.


2 Patriarch, and holy prophet.

Who prepared the way for Christ,

King, apostle, saint, confessor,

Martyr and evangelist;

Saintly maiden, golden matron,

Widows who have watched to prayer,

Joined in holy concert, singing,

To the Lord of all, are there.


3 Marching with Thy cross their banner,

They have triumphed, following

Thee, the Captain of salvation,

Thee, their Saviour and their King;

Gladly, Lord, with Thee they suffered;

Gladly, Lord, with Thee they died;

And by death to life immortal

They were born and glorified.


4 Now they reign in heavenly glory,

Now they walk in golden light,

Now they drink, as from a river,

Holy bliss and infinite:

Love and peace they taste for ever,

And all truth and knowledge see

In the beatific vision

Of the bless'd Trinity.


Amen.
