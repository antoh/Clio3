1. O Jesus, Joy of loving hearts!

Thou Fount of life! Thou Light of men!

From fullest bliss that earth imparts,

We turn unfilled to Thee again,

We turn unfilled to Thee again.


2. Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood,

Thou savest those that on Thee call;

To them that seek Thee, Thou art good,

To them that find Thee, all in all,

To them that find Thee, all in all.


3. We taste Thee, O Thou living Bread,

And long to feast upon Thee still;

We drink of Thee, the Fountain-head,

And thirst our souls from Thee to fill,

And thirst our souls from Thee to fill.


4. Our restless spirits yearn for Thee,

Where'er our change-ful lot is cast,

Glad that Thy gracious smile we see,

Blest, that our faith can hold Thee fast,

Blest, that our faith can hold Thee fast.


6. O Jesus, ever with us stay!

Make all our moments calm and bright;

Chase the dark night of sin away,

Shed o'er the world Thy holy light

Shed o'er the world Thy holy light.
