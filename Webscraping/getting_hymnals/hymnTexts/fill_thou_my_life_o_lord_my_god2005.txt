1 Fill now our life, O Lord our God, 

in every part with praise, 

that our whole being may proclaim 

your being and your ways. 


2 Not for the lip of praise alone, 

nor even the praising heart

we ask, but for a life made up 

of praise in every part. 


3 Praise in the common things of life, 

its goings out and in, 

praise in each duty and each deed,

though humble and unseen.


4 So, gracious Lord, you shall receive

from us the glory due,

and so we shall begin on earth

the song for ever new.
