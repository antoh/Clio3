PsH
1987
1 O Jesus, we adore you, 

upon the cross, our King. 

We bow our hearts before you; 

your gracious name we sing. 

That name has brought salvation, 

that name in life our stay, 

our peace, our consolation, 

when life shall fade away. 


2 The world does yet disdain you, 

still passing by the cross; 

Lord, may our hearts retain you; 

all else we count but loss. 

Ah, Lord, our sins arraigned you 

and nailed you to the tree; 

our pride, O Lord, disdained you, 

yet you have set us free. 


3 O glorious King, we praise you, 

no longer pass you by; 

O Jesus, we confess you 

the Son enthroned on high. 

Lord, grant to us forgiveness; 

life through your death restore; 

yes, grant to us the fullness 

of life forevermore.
