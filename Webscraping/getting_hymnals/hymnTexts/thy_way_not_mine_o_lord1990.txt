1 Thy way, not mine, O Lord,

How ever dark it be!

Lead me by thine own hand,

Choose out the path for me;

Smooth let it be or rough,

It will be still the best;

Winding or straight, it leads

Right onward to thy rest.


2 The kingdom that I seek

Is thine; so let the way

That leads to it be thine,

Else I must surely stray.

I dare not choose my lot;

I would not if I might:

Choose thou for me, my God,

So shall I walk aright.


3 Take thou my cup, and it

With joy or sorrow fill

As best to thee may seem;

Choose thou my good and ill.

Not mine, not mine the choice

In things or great or small;

Be thou my Guide, my Strength,

My Wisdom, and my All.
