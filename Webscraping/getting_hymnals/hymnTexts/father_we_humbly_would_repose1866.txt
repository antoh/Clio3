O Father! humbly we repose

Our souls on Thee, who dwell&#8217;st above,

And bless Thee for the peace which flows

From faith in Thine encircling love.

Though every earthly trust may break,

Infinite might belongs to Thee;

Though every earthly friend forsake,

Unchangeable Thou still wilt be.

Though griefs may gather darkly round,

They cannot veil us from Thy sight;

Though vain all human aid be found,

Thou every grief canst turn to light.

All things Thy wise designs fulfil,

In earth beneath, and heaven above,

And good breaks out from every ill,

Through faith in Thine encircling love.
