1 Crown Him with many crowns,

The Lamb upon His throne.

Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns

All music but its own!

Awake, my soul, and sing

Of Him Who died for thee,

And hail Him as thy matchless King

Through all eternity.


2 Crown Him the Lord of love!

Behold His hands and side--

Rich wounds, yet visible above,

In beauty glorified.

All hail, Redeemer, hail!

For Thou hast died for me:

Thy praise and glory shall not fail

Throughout eternity.


3 Crown Him the Lord of life!

Who triumphed o'er the grave,

Who rose victorious in the strife

For those He came to save.

His glories now we sing,

Who died and rose on high,

Who died eternal life to bring

And lives that death may die.


4 Crown Him the Lord of heaven!

One with the Father known,

One with the Spirit through Him given

From yonder glorious throne.

To Thee be endless praise,

For Thou for us hast died.

Be Thou, O Lord, through endless days

Adored and magnified!
