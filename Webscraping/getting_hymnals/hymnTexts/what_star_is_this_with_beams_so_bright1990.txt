1 What star is this, with beams so bright,

More lovely than the noonday light?

'Tis sent to announce a newborn King,

Glad tidings of our God to bring.


2 'Tis now fulfilled what God decreed,

From Jacob shall a star proceed;

And lo! the Eastern sages stand

To read in heaven the Lord's command.


3 O Jesus, while the star of grace

Impels us on to seek Your face,

Let not our slothful hearts refuse

The guidance of Your light to use. 


4 To God the Father, God the Son,

And Holy Spirit, Three in One,

May every tongue and nation raise

An endless song of thankful praise.
