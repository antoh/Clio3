1 Come, Thou Bright and Morning Star,

Light of Light without beginning!

Shine upon us from afar

That we may be kept from sinning.

Drive away by Thy clear light

Our dark night.


2 Let Thy grace, like morning dew

Falling soft on barren places,

Comfort, quicken, and renew

Our dry souls and dying graces;

Bless Thy flock from Thy rich store

Evermore.


3 May Thy fervent love destroy

Our cold works, in us awaking

Ardent zeal and holy joy

At the purple morn's first breaking.

Let us truly rise ere yet

Life has set.


4 Ah! Thou Dayspring from on high,

Grant that at Thy next appearing 

We who in the graves do lie

May arise, Thy summons hearing,

And rejoice in our new life,

Far from strife.


5 Light us to those heav'nly spheres,

Sun of grace, in glory shrouded;

Lead us through this vale of tears

To the land where days unclouded,

Purest joy, and perfect peace

Never cease.
