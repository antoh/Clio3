1. Gracious Savior, gentle Shepherd,

Our little ones are dear to Thee;

Gathered with Thine arms and carried

In Thy bosom, may they be

Sweetly, fondly, safely tended,

From all want and danger free.


2. Tender Shepherd, never leave them

From Thy fold to go astray;

By Thy look of love directed,

May they walk the narrow way;

Thus direct them and protect them,

Lest they fall an easy prey.


3. Let Thy holy Word instruct them;

Fill their minds with heavn'ly light;

Let Thy love and grace constrain them

To approve whate'er is right,

Take Thine easy yoke and wear it,

And to prove Thy burden light.


4. Taught to lisp the holy praises

Which on earth Thy children sing,

Both with lips and hearts unfeigned

Glad thank-off'rings may they bring;

Then, with all the saints in glory,

Join to praise their Lord and King.
