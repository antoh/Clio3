1 Not what these hands have done

Can save this guilty soul;

Not what this toiling flesh has borne

Can make my spirit whole.


2 Not what I feel or do

Can give me peace with God;

Not all my prayers and sighs and tears

Can bear my awful load.


3 Thy work alone, O Christ,

Can ease this weight of sin;

Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God,

Can give me peace within.


4 Thy grace alone, O God,

To me can pardon speak;

Thy power alone, O Son of God,

Can this sore bondage break.


5 I bless the Christ of God;

I rest on love divine;

And with unfalt'ring lip and heart

I call this Savior mine.


Amen.
