1 I lay my sins on Jesus, the spotless Lamb of God;

he bears them all and frees us from the accur'd load.

I bring my guilt to Jesus, to wash my crimson stains

clean in his blood most precious, till not a spot remains.


2 I lay my needs on Jesus; all fullness dwells in him;

he heals all my diseases; my soul he does redeem.

I lay my griefs on Jesus, my burdens and my cares;

he from them all releases; he all my sorrows shares.


3 I long to be like Jesus--meek, loving, lowly, mild;

I long to be like Jesus--the Father's holy Child.

I long to be with Jesus, amid the heavenly throng,

to sing with saints his praises, to learn the angels' song.


Name abroad is poured.


4 I long to be like Jesus,

Meek, loving, lowly, mild;

I long to be like Jesus,

The Father's holy Child;

I long to be with Jesus

Amid the heav'nly throng,

To sing with saints his praises,

To learn the angels' song.
