God the All-terrible! King, who ordainest

Great winds thy clarions, lightnings thy sword,

Show forth thy pity on high where thou reignest;

Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

God the Omnipotent! Mighty Avenger,

Watching invisible, judging unheard,

Save us in mercy, O save us from danger;

Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

God the All-merciful! Earth hath forsaken

Thy ways of blessedness, slighted thy Word;

Bid not thy wrath in its terrors awaken;

Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

God the All-righteous One! Man hath defied thee;

Yet to eternity standeth thy Word;

Falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside thee;

Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

God the All-wise! By the fire of thy chastening,

Earth shall to freedom and truth be restored;

Through the thick darkness thy kingdom is hastening;

Thou wilt give peace in thy time, O Lord.
