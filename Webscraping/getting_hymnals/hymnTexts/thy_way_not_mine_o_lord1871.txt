1 Thy way, not mine, O Lord,

However dark it be:

Lead me by Thine own hand,

Choose out the path for me.

Smooth let it be or rough,

It will be still the best;

Winding or straight, it leads

Right onward to Thy Rest


2 I dare not choose my lot;

I would not if I might:

Choose Thou for me, my God;

So shall I walk aright.

Take Thou my cup, and it

With joy or sorrow fill

As best to Thee may seem;

Choose Thou my good and ill.


3 Choose Thou for me my friends,

My sickness or my health;

Choose Thou my cares for me,

My poverty or wealth.

Not mine, not mine the choice

In things or great or small;

Be Thou my guide, my strength,

My wisdom, and my all.
