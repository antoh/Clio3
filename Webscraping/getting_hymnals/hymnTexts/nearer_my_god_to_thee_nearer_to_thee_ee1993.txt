1 Nearer, my God, to Thee,

nearer to Thee!

E'en though it be a cross

That raiseth me;

Still all my song would be

Refrain:

Nearer, my God, to Thee,

Nearer my God, to Thee,

Nearer to Thee.

2 Though like the wanderer,

The sun goes down,

Darkness be over me,

My rest a stone;

Yet in my dreams I'd be (refrain)

3 There let the way appear,

Steps unto heav'n;

All that Thou sendest me,

In mercy giv'n;

Angels to beckon me (refrain)

4 Then, with my waking thoughts,

Bright with Thy praise,

Out of my stony griefs,

Bethel I'll raise;

So by my woes to be (refrain)

5 Or if on joyful wing,

Cleaving the sky,

Sun, moon and stars forgot,

Upwards I fly,

Still all my song shall be (refrain)
