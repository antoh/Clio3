1 Conquering kings their titles take

From the foes they captive make:

Jesus, by a nobler deed,

From the thousands He hath freed.


2 Yes: no other Name is given

Unto mortals under heaven,

Which can make the dead arise,

And exalt them to the skies.


3 We would gladly for that Name

Bear the cross, endure the shame:

Joyfully for Him to die,

Is not death but victory.


4 Jesus, Who dost condescend

To be called the sinner's Friend,

Hear us, as to Thee we pray,

Glorying in Thy Name to-day.


Amen.
