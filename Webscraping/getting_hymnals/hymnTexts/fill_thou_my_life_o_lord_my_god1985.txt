1 Fill thou my life, O Lord my God, 

in every part with praise, 

that my whole being may proclaim 

thy being and thy ways. 


2 Not for the lip of praise alone, 

nor e'en the praising heart --

I ask but for a life made up 

of praise in ev'ry part. 


3 Praise in the common things of life, 

its goings out and in, 

praise in each duty and each deed,

however small and mean.


4 So shalt thou, gracious Lord, from me

receive the glory due,

and so shall I begin on earth

the song forever new.


5 So shall no part of day or night 

from sacredness be free, 

but all my life, in ev'ry step, 

be fellowship with thee.
