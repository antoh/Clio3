Thou, infinite in love!

Guide this bewildered mind,

Which, like the trembling dove,

No resting-place can find

On the wild waters,&#8212;God of light,

Through the thick darkness lead me right!

Bid the fierce conflict cease,

And fear and anguish fly;

Let there again be peace,

As in the days gone by:

In Jesus&#8217; name I cry to Thee,

Remembering Gethsemane.

Fain would earth&#8217;s true and dear

Save me in this dark hour;

And art not Thou more near?

Art Thou not love and power?

Vain is the help of man,&#8212;but Thou

Canst send deliverance even now.

Though through the future&#8217;s shade

Pale phantoms I descry,

Let me not shrink dismayed,

But ever feel Thee nigh;

There may be grief, and pain, and care

But, O my Father! Thou art there.
