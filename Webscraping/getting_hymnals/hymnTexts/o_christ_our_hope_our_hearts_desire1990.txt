1 O Christ, our hope, our heart's desire,

Redemption's only spring!

Creator of the world art thou,

Its Saviour and its King.


2 How vast the mercy and the love

Which laid our sins on thee,

And led thee to a cruel death,

To set thy people free.


3 But now the bands of death are burst,

The ransom has been paid;

And thou art on thy Father's throne,

In glorious robes arrayed.


4 O Christ, be thou our lasting joy,

Our ever great reward!

Our only glory may it be

To glory in the Lord.
