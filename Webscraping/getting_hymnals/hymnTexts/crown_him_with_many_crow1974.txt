1 Crown Him with many crowns,

The Lamb upon His throne;

Hark! how the heav'nly anthem drowns

All music but its own!

Awake, my soul, and sing

Of Him who died for thee,

And hail Him as thy matchless King

Thro' all eternity.


2 Crown Him the Son of God

Before the worlds began,

And ye, who tread where He hath trod,

Crown Him the Son of Man;

Who every grief hath known

that wrings the human breast,

And takes and bears them for His own,

That all in Him may rest.


3 Crown Him the Lord of life,

Who triumphed o'er the grave,

And rose victorious in the strife

For those He came to save;

His glories now we sing,

Who died and rose on high,

Who died eternal life to bring,

And lives that death may die.


4 Crown Him the Lord of love!

Behold His hands and side,

Those wounds, yet visible above,

In beauty glorified:

All hail, Redeemer, hail!

For Thou hast died for me:

Thy praise and glory shall not fail

Thro'out eternity.


Amen.
