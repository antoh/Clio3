1 Behold, the Lamb of God!

O thou for sinners slain,

let it not be in vain that thou hast died.

Thee for my Savior let me take.

My only refuge let me make they pierced side.


2  Behold, the Lamb of God!

All hail, incarnate Word!

Thou everlasting Lord, thou Savior blest!

Fill us with love that never faints.

Grant us with all thy blessed saints eternal rest.


3 Behold, the Lamb of God!

Worthy is he alone

to sit upon the throne of God above,

one with the Ancient of All Days,

one with the Comforter in praise, all light, all love!
