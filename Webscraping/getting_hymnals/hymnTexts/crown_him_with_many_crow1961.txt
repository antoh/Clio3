Crown him with many crowns,

The Lamb upon his throne;

Hark! how the heav'nly anthem drowns

All music but its own:

Awake, my soul, and sing

Of him who died for thee,

And hail him as thy matchless King

Through all eternity.

Crown him the Lord of love;

Behold his hands and side,

Rich wounds, yet visible above,

In beauty glorified:

No angel in the sky

Can fully bear that sight,

But downward bends his burning eye

At mysteries so bright.

Crown him the Lord of peace;

Whose pow'r a scepter sways

From pole to pole, that wars may cease,

Absorbed in prayer and praise:

His reign shall know no end;

And round his pierced feet

Fair flowers of Paradise extend

Their fragrance ever sweet.

Crown him the Lord of years,

The Potentate of time;

Creator of the rolling spheres,

Ineffably sublime:

All hail, Redeemer, hail!

For thou hast died for me:

Thy praise shall never, never fail

Throughout eternity.
