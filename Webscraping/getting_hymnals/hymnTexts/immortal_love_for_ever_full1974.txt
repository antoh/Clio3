1 Immortal Love, for ever full,

Forever flowing free,

Forever shared, forever whole,

A never-ebbing sea!


2 We may not climb the heav'nly steeps

To bring the Lord Christ down;

In vain we search the lowest deeps,

For Him no depths can drown.


3 But warm, sweet, tender, even yet

A present help is he;

And faith has still its Olivet,

And love its Galilee.


4 The healing of His seamless dress

Is by our beds of pain;

We touch Him in life's throng and press,

And we are whole again.


5 O Lord and Master of us all,

Whate'er our name or sign,

We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,

We test our lives by Thine!


Amen.
