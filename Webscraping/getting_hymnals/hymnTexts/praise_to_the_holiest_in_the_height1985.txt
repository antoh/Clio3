1 Praise to the Holiest in the height,

and in the depth be praise;

in all his words most wonderful,

most sure in all his ways!


2 O loving wisdom of our God!

When all was sin and shame,

a second Adam to the fight

and to the rescue came.


3 O wisest love! that flesh and blood,

which did in Adam fail,

should strive afresh against the foe,

should strive, and should prevail:


4 and that the highest gift of grace

should flesh and blood refine;

God's presence and his very self,

and essence all-divine.


5 Praise to the Holiest in the height,

and in the depth be praise;

in all his words most wonderful,

most sure in all his ways!
