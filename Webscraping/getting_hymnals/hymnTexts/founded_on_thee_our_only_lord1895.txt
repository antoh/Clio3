1 Founded on Thee, our only Lord,

On Thee, the everlasting Rock,

The Church shall stand, as stands Thy word,

Nor fear the storm, nor dread the shock.


2 For Thee our waiting spirits yearn,

For Thee this house of praise we rear;

To Thee with longing hearts we turn:

Come, fix Thy glorious presence here.


3 Come, with Thy Spirit and Thy power,

The Conqueror, once the Crucified;

Our God, our Strength, our King, our Tower,

Here plant Thy throne, and here abide.


4 Accept the work our hands hath wrought;

Accept, O God, this earthly shrine;

Be Thou our Rock, our life, our thought,

And we, as living temples, Thine.


Amen.
