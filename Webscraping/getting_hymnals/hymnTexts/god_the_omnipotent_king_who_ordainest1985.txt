1 God the Omnipotent! King, who ordainest

thunder thy clarion, the lightning thy sword;

show forth thy pity on high where thou reignest:

give to us peace in our time, O Lord.


2 God the All-merciful! earth hath forsaken

thy ways all holy, and slighted thy word;

bid not thy wrath in its terrors awaken:

give to us peace in our time, O Lord.


3 God, the All-righteous One! we have defied thee;

yet to eternity standeth thy word;

falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside thee:

give to us peace in our time, O Lord.


4 God the All-provident! earth by thy chastening,

yet shall to freedom and truth be restored;

through the thick darkness thy Kingdom is hastening:

thou wilt give peace in our time, O Lord.
