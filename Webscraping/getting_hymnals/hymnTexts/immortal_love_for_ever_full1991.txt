1.  Immortal Love, for ever full,

Forever flowing free,

Forever shared, forever whole,

A never-ebbing sea!


2.  We may not climb the heav'nly steeps

To bring the Lord Christ down;

In vain we search the lowest deeps,

For Him no depths can drown.


3.  The healing of His seamless dress

Is by our beds of pain;

We touch Him in life's throng and press,

And we are whole agian.


4.  O Lord and Master of us all,

Whate'er our name or sign,

We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,

We test our lives by Thine.
