1 Thy way, not mine, O Lord,

However dark it be!

Lead me by Thine own hand,

Choose out the path for me.


2 Smooth let it be or rough,

It will be still the best;

Winding or straight, it leads

Right onward to Thy res


3 I dare not choose my lot;

I would not if I might:

Choose Thou for me, my God,

So shall I walk aright.


4 The kingdom that I seek

Is Thine; so let the way

That leads to it be Thine,

Else I must surely stray.


5 Take Thou my cup, and it

With joy or sorrow fill

As best to Thee may seem;

Choose Thou my good and ill.


6 Choose Thou for me my friends,

My sickness or my health;

Choose Thou my cares for me,

My poverty or wealth.


7 Not mine, not mine the choice

In things or great or small;

Be Thou my Guide, my Strength,

My Wisdom, and my All.


Amen.
