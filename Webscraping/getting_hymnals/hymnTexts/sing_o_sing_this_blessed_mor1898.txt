1 Sing, O, sing, this bless'd morn;

Unto us a Child is born,

Unto us a Son is given,

God Himself comes down from heaven;

Sing, oh, sing, this bless'd morn,

Jesus Christ today is born.


2 God of God, and Light of Light,

Comes with mercies infinite,

Joining in a wondrous plan

Heaven to earth, and God to man.

Sing, oh, sing, this bless'd morn,

Jesus Christ today is born.


3 God with us, Emmanuel,

Deigns forever now to dwell;

He on Adam's fallen race

Sheds the fullness of His grace.

Sing, oh, sing, this bless'd morn,

Jesus Christ today is born.


4 God comes down that man may rise,

Lifted by Him to the skies;

Christ is Son of Man that we

Sons of God in Him may be.

Sing, oh, sing, this bless'd morn,

Jesus Christ today is born.


5 Oh, renew us, Lord, we pray,

With Thy Spirit day by day,

That we ever one may be

With the Father and with Thee.

Sing, oh, sing, this bless'd morn,

Jesus Christ today is born.


Amen.
