By Christ redeemed, in Christ restored,

We keep the memory adored,

And show the death of our dear Lord,

Until he come.


His Body broken in our stead

Is here, in this memorial bread;

And so our feeble love is fed,

Until he come.


His fearful drops of agony,

His Life-blood shed for us we see:

The wine shall tell the mystery,

Until he come.


And thus that dark betrayal night,

With the last Advent we unite

The shame, the glory, by this rite,

Until he come.


Until the trump of God be heard,

Until the ancient graves be stirred,

And with the great commanding word,

The Lord shall come.


306

O bless'd hope! with this elate,

Let not our hearts be desolate,

But strong in faith, in patience wait,

Until he come!
