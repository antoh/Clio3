1 Jesus, thou joy of loving hearts,

thou light of life, thou fount of grace;

from the best bliss that earth imparts

we turn unfilled to seek thy face.


2 Thy truth unchanged has ever stood;

thou savest those that on thee call:

to them that seek thee thou art good,

to them that find thee, all in all.


3 We taste thee, O thou living bread,

and long to feast upon thee still;

we drink of thee, the fountain-head,

and thirst our souls from thee to fill.


4 Our restless spirits yearn for thee,

where'er our changeful lot is cast,

glad when thy gracious smile we see,

blest when our faith can hold thee fast.


5 O Jesus, ever with us stay;

make all our moments calm and bright;

chase the dark night of sin away;

shed o'er the world thy holy light.
