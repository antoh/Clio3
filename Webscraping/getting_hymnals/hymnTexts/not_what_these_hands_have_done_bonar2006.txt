1 Not what my hands have done

Can save this guilty soul;

Not what this toiling flesh has borne

Can make my spirit whole.


2 Not what I feel or do

Can give me peace with God;

Not all my prayers and sighs and tears

Can bear my awful load.


3 Thy work alone, O Christ,

Can ease this weight of sin;

Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God,

Can give me peace within.


4 Thy love to me, O God,

Not mine, O Lord to Thee,

Can rid me of this dark unrest

And set my spirit free.


5 Thy grace alone, O God,

To me can pardon speak;

Thy pow'r alone, O Son of God,

Can this sore bondage break.


6 I bless the Christ of God,

I rest on love divine;

And with unfalt'ring lip and heart

I call this Saviour mine.
