1 Around the throne of God in heav'n

Thousands of children stand,

Children whose sins are all forgiv'n,

A holy, happy band,


Refrain:

Singing, "Glory, glory,

Glory be to God on high."


2 In flowing robes of spotless white

See ev'ry one arrayed;

Dwelling in everlasting light

And joys that never fade, (Refrain)


3 What brought them to that world above,

That heav'n so bright and fair,

Where all is peace, and joy, and love;

How came those children there, (Refrain)


4 Because the Saviour shed his blood

To wash away their sin;

Bathed in that pure and precious flood,

Behold them white and clean, (Refrain)


5 On earth they sought the Saviour's grace,

On earth they loved his Name;

So now they see his blessed face,

And stand before the Lamb, (Refrain)
