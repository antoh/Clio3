1 To Him Who for our sins was slain.

To Him, for all His dying pain,

Sing we Alleluia!

To Him the Lamb, our sacrifice,

Who gave His blood our ransom-price,

Sing we Alleluia!

Sing we Alleluia!


2 To Him Who died that we might die

To sin, and live to Him on high,

Sing we Alleluia!

To Him Who rose that we might rise,

And reign with Him beyond the skies,

Sing we Alleluia!

Sing we Alleluia!


3 To Him Who now for us doth plead,

And helpeth us in all our need,

Sing we Alleluia!

To Him Who doth prepare on high

Our home in immortality,

Sing we Alleluia!

Sing we Alleluia!


4 To Him be glory evermore:

Ye heavenly hosts, your Lord adore;

Sing we Alleluia!

To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,

Our God most great, our joy, our boast,

Sing we Alleluia!

Sing we Alleluia!


Amen.
