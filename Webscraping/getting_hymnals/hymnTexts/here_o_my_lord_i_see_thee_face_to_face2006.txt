1 Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;

Here would I touch and handle things unseen;

Here grasp with firmer hand th'eternal grace,

And all my weariness upon Thee lean.


2 Here would I feed upon the bread of God,

Here drink with Thee the royal wine of heav'n;

Here would I lay aside each earthly load,

ere taste afresh the calm of sin forgiv'n.


3 This is the hour of banquet and of song;

This is the heav'nly table spread for me;

Here let me feast and, feasting still prolong

The brief bright hour of fellowship with thee.


4 I have no help but Thine; nor do I need

Another arm but Thine to lean upon.

It is enough, my Lord, enough indeed;

My strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone.


5 Mine is the sin, but Thine the righteousness;

Mine is the guilt, but Thine the cleansing blood;

Here is my robe, my refuge, and my peace;

Thy blood, Thy righteousness, O Lord, my God.


6 Too soon we rise; the vessels disappear;

The feast, though not the love, is past and gone;

The bread and wine remove; but Thou art here,

Nearer than ever; still my shield and sun.


7 Feast after feast thus comes and passes by,

Yet, passing, points to that glad feast above,

Giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy,

The Lamb's great marriage feast of bliss and love.
