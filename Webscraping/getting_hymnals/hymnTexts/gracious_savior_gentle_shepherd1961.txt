Gracious Saviour, gentle Shepherd,

Our little ones are dear to thee;

Gathered with thine arms and carried

In thy bosom may they be

Sweetly, gently, safely tended,

From all want and danger free.

Tender Shepherd, never leave them

From thy fold to go astray;

By thy look of love directed,

May they walk the narrow way;

Thus direct them, and protect them,

Lest they fall an easy prey.

Let thy holy Word instruct them:

Fill their minds with heav'nly light;

Let thy love and grace constrain them,

To approve whate'er is right,

Take thine easy yoke and wear it,

And to prove thy burden light.

Cleanse their hearts from sinful folly

In the stream thy love supplied;

Mingled streams of blood and water

Flowing from thy wounded side:

And to heav'nly pastures lead them,

Where thine own still waters glide.
