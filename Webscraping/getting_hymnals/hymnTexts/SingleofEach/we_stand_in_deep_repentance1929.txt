1. We stand in deep repentance

Before Thy throne of love;

O God of grace, forgive us,

The stain of guilt remove;

Behold us while with weeping

We lift our eyes to Thee,

And, all our sins subduing,

Our Father, set us free.


2. O shouldst Thou from us sinners

Withhold Thy grace to guide,

Forever we should wander

From Thee, and peace, aside;

But Thou to spirits contrite

Dost light and life impart,

That man may learn to serve Thee

With thankful, joyous heart.


3. Our souls--on Thee we cast them,

Our only refuge Thou!

Thy cheering words revive us,

When pressed with grief we bow;

Thou bear'st the trusting spirit

Upon Thy loving breast,

And givest all The ransomed

A sweet, unending rest.
