1 So rest, my Rest,

Thou Ever-blest!

Thy grave with sinners making;

By Thy precious death from sin

My dead soul awaking.


2 After Thy strife,

Life of my life,

Thy fervent love hath driven

Thee into the cold, dark grave

Thst I might gain heaven.


3 Breath of all breath!

I know from death

Thou wilt my dust awaken;

Wherefore should I dread the grave

Or my faith be shaken?


4 To me the tomb

Shall be a room

Where I lie down on roses;

Who by faith hath conquered death

Sweetly there reposes.


5 Meantime I will

My Savior, still

Deep in my bosom lay Thee,

Ever musing on Thy death.

Leave me not, I pray Thee!
