O Lord! how happy should we be,

If we could leave our cares to Thee,

If we from self could rest,

And feel at heart that One above,

In perfect wisdom, perfect love,

Is working for the best.

For when we kneel and cast our care

Upon our God in humble prayer,

With strengthened souls we rise;

Sure that our Father, who is nigh

To hear the ravens when they cry,

Will hear His children&#8217;s cries.

O, may these trustless hearts of ours

The lesson learn from birds and flowers,

And learn from self to cease,&#8212;

Leave all things to our Father&#8217;s will,

And, on His mercy, leaning still,

Find, in each trial, peace!
