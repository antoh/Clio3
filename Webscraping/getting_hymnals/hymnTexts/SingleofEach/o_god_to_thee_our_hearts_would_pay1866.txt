O God! to Thee our hearts would pay

Their gratitude sincere,

Whose love hath kept us, night and day,

Throughout another year.

Of every breath, and every power,

Thou wast the gracious source;

From Thee came every happy hour

Which smiled along its course.

And if sometimes across our path

A cloud its shadows threw,

Thou didst not waft it there in wrath,

But loving-kindness true.

For joy and grief alike we pay

Our thanks to Thee above;

And only pray to grow each day

More worthy of Thy love.
