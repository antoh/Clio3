1 No, not despairingly

Come I to Thee;

No, not distrustingly

Bend I the knee:

Sin hath gone over me,

Yet is this still my plea,

Jesus hath died.


2 Ah! Mine iniquity

Crimson has been,

Infinite, infinite, 

Sin upon sin;

Sin of not loving Thee,

Sin of not trusting Thee,

Infinite sin.


3 Lord, I confess to Thee

Sadly my sin;

All am tell I Thee,

All I have been:

Purge Thou my sin away,

Wash Thou my soul this day;

Lord, make me clean.


4 Faithful and just art Thou,

Forgiving all;

Loving and kind art Thou

When poor ones call:

Lord, let the cleansing blood,

Blood of the Lamb of God,

Pass o'er my soul.


5 Then all is peace and light

This soul within;

Thus shall I walk with Thee,

The loved Unseen;

Leaning on Thee, my God,

Guided along the road,

Nothing between.


Amen.
