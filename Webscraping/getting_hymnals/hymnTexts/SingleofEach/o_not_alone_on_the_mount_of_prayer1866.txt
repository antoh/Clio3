O, not alone on the mount of prayer

Must the Christian serve his God;

But the burden of daily life must bear,

And tread where his Saviour trod.

Yet with him through every changing scene

Doth the spirit of prayer abide;

When earth is lovely, and heaven serene,

That spirit his course shall guide.

And when the storm rages, and woe and wrath

Would an earth-born courage quell,

He knows that his God is around his path,

And ordereth all things well.
