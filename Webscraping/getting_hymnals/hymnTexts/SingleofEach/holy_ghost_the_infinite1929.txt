1. Holy Ghost, the Infinite,

Shine upon our nature's night

With Thy blessed holy light,

Comforter Divine.


2. We are sinful, cleanse us, Lord;

We are faint, Thy strength afford;

Lost, until by Thee restored,

Comforter Divine.


3. Like the dew, Thy peace distil;

Guide, subdue our wayward will,

Things of Christ unfolding still,

Comforter Divine.


4. In us, for us, intercede,

And with voiceless groanings plead

Our unutterable need,

Comforter Divine.


5. In us "Abba, Father," cry,

Earnest of our bliss on high,

Seal of immortality,

Comforter Divine.


6. Search for us the depths of God;

Lead us by the narrow road

To the height of Thine abode,

Comforter Divine.
