1 Lord, Thou in all things like wast made

To us, yet free from sin,

Then how unlike to us, O Lord,

Replies the voice within.


2 Our faith is weak; O Light of Light,

Clear Thou our clouded view;

That Son of Man, and Son of God,

We give Thee honor due.


3 O Son of Man, Thyself hast proved

Our trials and our tears;

Life's thankless toil and scant repose,

Death's agonies and fears.


4 O Son of God, in glory raised,

Thou sittest on Thy throne:

Thence, by Thy pleadings and Thy grace,

Still succoring Thine own.


5 Brother and Saviour, Friend and Judge!

To Thee, O Christ, be given

To bind upon Thy crown the names

Most blest in earth and heaven.


Amen.
