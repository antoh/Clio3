1 Once more the solemn season calls

A holy fast to keep;

And now within the temple walls

Both priest and people weep.


2 But vain all outward sign of grief,

And vain the form of prayer,

Unless the heart implore relief,

And penitence be there.


3 We smite the breast, we weep in vain,

In vain in ashes mourn,

Unless with penitential pain

The smitten soul be torn.


4 In sorrow true then let us pray

To our offended God,

From us to turn His wrath away,

And stay the uplifted rod.


5 O God, our Judge and Father, deign

To spare the bruis'd reed;

We pray for time to turn again,

For grace to turn indeed.


6 Blest Three in One, to Thee we bow;

Vouchsafe us in Thy love

To gather from these fasts below

Immortal fruit above.
