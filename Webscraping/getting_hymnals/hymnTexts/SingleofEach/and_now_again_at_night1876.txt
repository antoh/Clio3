1.

And now again at night,

O Christ, the living Word,

Thou Light of the Eternal Light,

Be Thou by us adored.


2.

Thou dost the Spirit give,

Third Light, in glory one;

His grace, by whom alone we live,

Thou dost refuse to none.


3.

Thou didst the darkness scatter,

Thou mad'st the light to shine,

That now through all primeval matter

Might spring delight divine.


4.

It, a rude mass before,

From Thee took order new;

And shapely form, and steadfast law,

So beautiful to view.


5.

And mind of man with light

From heaven Thou didst endow,

By word and wisdom that he might

Thine image bear below;


6.

And lighted in his soul,

Thine own great Light might see;

And thenceforth not in part, but whole,

Himself all light might be.


7.

And heaven Thou didst array,

With those bright orbs above;

And day to night, and night to day,

Proclaim Thy law of love;


8.

Yielding in turn; the one

To worn-out flesh brings rest!

The other calls, "Let work be done!"

Such work as Thou lov'st best.
