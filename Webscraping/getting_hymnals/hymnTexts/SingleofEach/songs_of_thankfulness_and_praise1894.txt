1 Songs of thankfulness and praise

Jesu, Lord, to Thee we raise.

Manifested by the star

To the sages from afar;

Branch of royal David's stem

In Thy birth at Bethlehem;

Anthems be to Thee addressed,

God in Man made manifest.


2 Manifest at Jordan's stream,

Prophet, Priest, and King supreme;

And at Cana, wedding-guest,

In Thy God-head manifest;

Manifest in power divine,

Changing water in to wine;

Anthems be to Thee addressed,

God in Man made manifest.


3 Manifest in making whole

Palsied limbs and fainting soul;

Manifest in valiant fight,

Quelling all the devil's might;

Manifest in gracious will,

Ever bringing good from ill;

Anthems be to Thee addressed,

God in Man made manifest.


4 Sun and moon shall darkened be.

Stars shall fall, and heavens shall flee;

Christ will then like lightning shine,

All will see His glorious sign:

All will then the trumpet hear;

All will see the Judge appear;

Thou by all wilt be confessed,

God in Man made manifest.


5 Grant us grace to see Thee, Lord,

Present in Thy holy Word;

May we imitate Thee now,

And be pure, as pure art Thou;

That we like to Thee may be

At Thy great Epiphany;

And may praise Thee, ever blest,

God in Man made manifest.


Amen.
