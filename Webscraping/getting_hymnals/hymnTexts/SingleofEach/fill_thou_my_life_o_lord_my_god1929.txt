1. Fill Thou, my life, O Lord, my God,

In ev'ry part with praise,

That my whole being may proclaim

Thy being and Thy ways;

Not for the lip of praise alone,

Nor e'en the praising heart,

I ask, but for a life made up

Of praise in ev'ry part.


2. Praise in the common words I speak,

Life's common looks and tones,

In intercouse at hearth or board

With my beloved ones,--

Enduring wrong, reproach, or loss

With sweet and steadfast will,

Loving and blessing those who hate,

Returning good for ill.


3. So shall each fear, each fret, each care,

Be turned into song,

And ev'ry winding of the way

The echo shall prolong;

So shall no part of day or night

From sacredness be free,

But all my life, in ev'ry step,

Be fellowship with Thee.
