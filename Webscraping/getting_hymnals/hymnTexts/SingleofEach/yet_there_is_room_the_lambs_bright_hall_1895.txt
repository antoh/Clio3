1 "Yet there is room:" the Lamb's bright hall of song,

With its fair glory, beckons thee along:

Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.


2 Day is declining, and the sun is low;

The shadows lengthen, light makes haste to go:

Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.


3 The bridal hall is filling for the feast;

Pass in, pass in, and be the Bridegroom's guest:

Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.


4 It fills, it fills, that hall of jubilee!

Make haste, make haste, 'tis not too full for thee:

Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.


5 Yet there is room: still open stands the gate,

The gate of love; it is not yet too late:

Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.


6 O enter in; that banquet is for thee;

That cup of everlasting joy is free:

Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.


7 All heaven is there, all joy! Go in, go in;

The angels beckon thee the prize to win:

Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.


8 Louder and sweeter sounds the loving call;

Come, lingerer, come; enter that festal hall:

Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.


9 Ere night that gate may close, and seal thy doom;

Then the last low, long cry, "No room, no room!"

No room, no room! O woeful cry, "No room!"


Amen.
