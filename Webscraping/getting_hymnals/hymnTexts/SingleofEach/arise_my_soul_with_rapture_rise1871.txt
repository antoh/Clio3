1 Arise, my soul, with rapture rise,

And, fill'd with love and fear, adore

The awful Sovereign of the skies,

Whose mercy lends me one day more.


2 And may this day, indulgent Power,

Not idly pass, nor fruitless be;

But may each swiftly-flying hour

Still nearer bring my soul to Thee.


3 But can it be? That Power Divine

Is throned in light's unbounded blaze;

And countless worlds and angels join

To swell the glorious song of praise.


4 And will He deign to lend an ear,

When I, poor sinful mortal, pray?

Yes, boundless goodness! He will hear,

Nor cast the meanest wretch away.


5 Then let me serve Thee all my days,

And may my zeal with years increase;

For pleasant, Lord, are all Thy ways,

And all Thy paths are paths of peace.
