Sleep not, soldier of the cross!

Foes are lurking all around;

Look not here to find repose,

This is but thy battle-ground.

Up! and take thy shield and sword;

Up! it is the call of Heaven;

Shrink not faithless from thy Lord,

Nobly strive as he hath striven.

Break through all the force of ill;

Tread the might of passion down;

Struggle onward, upward still,

To the conquering Saviour&#8217;s crown!
