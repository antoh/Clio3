1. Crown Him with many crowns,

The lamb upon His throne!

Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns

All music but its own.

Awake, my soul, and sing

Of Him who died for thee,

And hail Him as thy matchless king

Through all eternity.


2. Crown Him the Lord of life,

Who triumphed o'er the grave

And rose victorious in the strife

For those He came to save.

His glories now we sing

Who died, and rose on high--

Who died eternal life to bring

And lives that death may die.


3. Crown Him of lords the Lord,

Who over all doth reign,

Who, once on earth, the incarnate word,

For sinful men was slain,

He lives in realms of light,

Where saints with angels sing

Their songs before Him day and night,

Their God, redeemer, king.
