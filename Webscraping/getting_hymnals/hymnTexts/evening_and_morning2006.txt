2006
1 Evening and morning, 

Sunset and dawning,

Wealth, peace and gladness, 

Comfort in sadness:

These are Thy works; all the glory be Thine!

Times without number, 

Awake or in slumber,

Thine eye observes us, 

From danger preserves us,

Causing Thy mercy upon us to shine.


2 Father, O hear me, 

Pardon and spare me;

Calm all my terrors, 

Blot out my errors,

That by Thine eyes they may no more be scanned.

Order my goings, 

Direct all my doings;

As it may please Thee, 

Retain or release me;

All I commit to Thy fatherly hand.
