1 Nearer, my God, to Thee, 

Nearer to Thee! 

E'en though it be a cross  

That raiseth me! 

Still all my song shall be, 

Nearer, my God, to Thee! 

Nearer, my God, to Thee, 

Nearer to Thee! 


2 There let the way appear, 

Steps unto heav'n; 

All that Thou sendest me, 

In mercy giv'n; 

Angels to beckon me  

Nearer, my God, to Thee! 

Nearer, my God, to Thee,

Nearer to Thee!


3 Then with my waking thoughts 

Bright with Thy praise, 

Out of my stony griefs 

Bethel, I'll raise; 

So by my woes to be  

Nearer, my God, to Thee! 

Nearer, my God, to Thee, 

Nearer to Thee!
