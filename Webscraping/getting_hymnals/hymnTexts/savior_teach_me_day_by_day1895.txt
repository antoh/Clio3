1 Saviour, teach me, day by day,

Love's sweet lesson,-- to obey;

Sweeter lesson cannot be,

Loving Him who first loved me.


2 With a child's glad heart of love,

At Thy bidding may I move;

Prompt to serve and follow Thee,

Loving Him who first loved me.


3 Teach me all Thy steps to trace,

Strong to follow in Thy grace;

Learning how to love from Thee;

Loving Tim who first loved me.


4 Love in loving finds employ,

In obedience all her joy;

Ever new that joy will be,

Loving Him who first loved me.


5 Though a foolish child and weak,

More than this I need not seek;

Singing, till Thy face I see,

Of His love who first loved me.


Amen.
