1.  Nearer, my God, to Thee,

Nearer to Thee!

E'en tho' it be a cross

That raiseth me;

Still all my song shall be,

Nearer, my God, to Thee!

Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!


2.  There let the way appear,

Steps unto heav'n;

All that Thou sendest me,

In mercy giv'n;

Angels to beckon me

Nearer, my God, to Thee!

Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!


3.  Then with my waking tho'ts

Bright with Thy praise,

Out of my stony griefs

Bethel I'll raise;

So by my woes to be

Nearer, my God, to Thee!

Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
