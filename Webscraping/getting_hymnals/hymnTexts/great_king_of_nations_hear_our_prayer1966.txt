1. Great King of nations, hear our prayer

While at thy feet we fall

And humbly with united cry

To thee for mercy call.

The guilt is ours, but grace is thine;

O turn us not away,

But hear us from thy lofty throne

And help us when we pray.


2. Our father's sins were manifold,

And ours no less we own;

Yet wondrously from age to age

Thy goodness hath been shown.

When dangers, like a stormy sea,

Beset our country round,

To thee we looked, to thee we cried,

And help in thee was found.


3. With one consent we meekly bow

Beneath thy chastening hand

And, pouring forth confession meet,

Mourn with our mourning land.

With pitying eye behold our need

As thus we lift our prayer;

Correct us with thy judgments, Lord,

Then let thy mercy spare.
