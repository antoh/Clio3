PsH
1987
1 Christ Jesus lay in death's strong bands, 

for our offenses given; 

but now at God's right hand he stands 

and brings us life from heaven. 

Therefore let us joyful be, 

and sing to God right thankfully 

loud songs of alleluia! 

Alleluia! 


2 It was a strange and dreadful strife 

when life and death contended. 

The victory remained with life; 

the reign of death was ended. 

Holy Scripture plainly says 

his death has swallowed up our death; 

its sting is lost forever. 

Alleluia! 


3 Here the true paschal Lamb we see, 

whom God so freely gave us. 

He died on the accursed tree  

so strong his love to save us. 

See, his blood now marks our door; 

faith points to it, death passes o'er, 

and Satan cannot harm us. 

Alleluia! 


4 So let us keep the festival 

to which the Lord invites us. 

Christ is himself the joy of all, 

the sun that warms and lights us. 

Now his grace to us imparts 

eternal sunshine to our hearts; 

the night of sin is ended. 

Alleluia! 


5 Then let us feast this holy day 

on Christ, the bread of heaven. 

The Word of grace has purged away 

the old and evil leaven. 

Christ alone our souls will feed; 

he is our meat and drink indeed; 

faith lives upon no other! 

Alleluia!
