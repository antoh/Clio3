Yes, for me, for me he careth

With a brother's tender care;

Yes, with me, with me he shareth

Ev'ry burden, ev'ry fear.

Yes, o'er me, o'er me he watcheth,

Ceaseless watcheth, night and day;

Yes, e'en me, e'en me he snatcheth

From the perils of the way.

Yes, for me, he standeth pleading

At the mercy seat above;

Ever for me interceding,

Constant in untiring love.

Yes, in me, in me he dwelleth;

I in him, and he in me!

And my empty soul he filleth,

Here and through eternity.
