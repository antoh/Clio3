Send kindly light amid the encircling gloom,

And lead me on!

The night is dark, and I am far from home;

Lead Thou me on!

Keep Thou my feet: I do not ask to see

The distant scene; one step enough for me.

I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou

Shouldst lead me on;

I loved to choose and see my path; but now

Lead Thou me on!

I loved day's dazzling light, and, spite of fears,

Pride ruled my will: remember not past years!

So long Thy power hath blessed me, surely still

'Twill lead me on

Through dreary doubt, through pain and sorrow, till

The night is gone,

And with the morn those angel faces smile

Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.
