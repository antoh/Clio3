1 O Lord and Master of us all,

whate'er our name or sign,

we own thy sway, we hear thy call,

we test our lives by Thine.


2 Thou judgest us; thy purity

doth all our lusts condemn;

the love that draws us nearer thee

is hot with wrath to them.


3 Yet weak and blinded though we be,

thou dost our service own;

we bring our varying gifts to thee,

and thou rejectest none.


4 Apart from thee all gain is loss,

all labor vainly done;

the solemn shadow of the cross

is better than the sun.


5 We faintly hear, we dimly see,

in diff'ring phrase we pray;

but, dim or clear, we own in thee

the Life, the Truth, the Way.
