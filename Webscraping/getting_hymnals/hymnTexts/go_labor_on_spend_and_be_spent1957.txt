1 Go, labor on; spend, and be spent,

Thy joy to do the Father's will;

It is the way the Master went;

Should not the servant tread it still?


2 Go, labor on; 'tis not for naught;

Thy earthly loss is heavenly gain:

Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not;

The Master praises: what are men?


3 Go, labor on while it is day:

The world's dark night is hastening on;

Speed, speed thy work, cast sloth away;

It is not thus that souls are won.


4 Toil on, faint not, keep watch and pray,

Be wise the erring soul to win;

Go forth into the world's highway,

Compel the wanderer to come in.


Amen.
