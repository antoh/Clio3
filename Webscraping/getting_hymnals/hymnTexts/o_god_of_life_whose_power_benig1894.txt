1 O God of life, whose power benign

Doth o'er the world in mercy shine,

Accept our praise, for we are Thine.


2 O Father, uncreated Lord,

Be Thou in every land adored,

Be Thou by all with faith implored.


3 O Son of God, for sinners slain,

We bless Thee, Lord, Whose dying pain

For us did endless life regain.


4 O Holy Ghost, Whose guardian care

Doth us for heavenly joys prepare,

May we in Thy communion share.


5 O Holy, Bless'd Trinity,

With faith we sinners bow to Thee;

In us, O God, exalted be.


Amen.
