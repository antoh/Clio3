Savior, teach me, day by day,

Love's sweet lesson to obey;

Sweeter lesson cannot be,

Loving him who first loved me.


With a childlike heart of love,

At thy bidding may I move;

Prompt to serve and follow thee,

Loving him who first loved me.


Teach me all thy steps to trace,

Strong to follow in thy grace;

Learning how to love from thee;

Loving him who first loved me


Love in loving finds employ,

In obedience all her joy;

Ever new that joy will be,

Loving him who first loved me.


Thus may I rejoice to show

That I feel the love I owe;

Singing, till thy face I see,

Of his love who first loved me.


Amen.
