Above the clear blue sky,

In heaven's bright abode,

The angel host on high

Sing praises to their God:

Alleluia!

They love to sing

To God their King

Alleluia!

But God from children's tongues

On earth receiveth praise;

We then our cheerful songs

In sweet accord will raise:

Alleluia!

We too will sing

To God our King

Alleluia!

O bless'd Lord, thy truth

To all thy flock impart,

And teach us in our youth

To know thee as thou art.

Alleluia!

Then shall we sing

To God our King

Alleluia!



O may thy holy word

Spread all the world around,

And all with one accord

Uplift the joyful sound:

Alleluia!

All then shall sing

To God their King

Alleluia!

Amen.
