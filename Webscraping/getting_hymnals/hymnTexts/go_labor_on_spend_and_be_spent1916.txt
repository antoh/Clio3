Go, labour on! spend and be spent!

Thy joy to do the Father's will;

It is the way the Master went;

Should not the servant tread it still?

Go, labour on! 'tis not for naught;

Thine earthly loss is heavenly gain;

Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not;

The Master praises: what are men?

Go, labour on! enough, while here,

If he shall praise thee, if he deign

The willing heart to mark and cheer:

No toil for him shall be in vain.

Go, labour on, while it is day!

The world's dark night is hastening on:

Speed, speed thy work! cast sloth away!

It is not thus that souls are won.

447

Toil on! faint not! keep watch, and pray!

Be wise the erring soul to win!

Go forth into the world's highway!

Compel the wanderer to come in!

Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice!

For toil comes rest, for exile home;

Soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom's voice,

The midnight peal, "Behold, I come!"
