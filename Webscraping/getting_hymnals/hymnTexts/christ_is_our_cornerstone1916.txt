Christ is our cornerstone,

On him alone we build:

With his true saints alone

The courts of heaven are filled;

On his great love our hopes we place,

Of present grace and joys above.

O then with hymns of praise

These hallowed courts shall ring;

Our voices we will raise

The Three in One to sing,

And thus proclaim in joyful song,

Both loud and long, that glorious Name.

Here, gracious God, do thou

For evermore draw nigh;

Accept each faithful vow,

And mark each suppliant sigh;

In copious shower on all who pray,

Each holy day thy blessings pour.

Here may we gain from heaven

The grace which we implore;

And may that grace, once given,

Be with us evermore;

Until that day when all the blest

To endless rest are called away.

Amen.
