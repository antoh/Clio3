1 Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me,

Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee.   


Refrain:

Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down,

Darkness be over me, my rest a stone;

Yet in my dreams I'd be nearer, my God, to Thee.


2 There let the way appear, steps unto Heav'n;

All that Thou sendest me, in mercy giv'n;

Angels to beckon me nearer, my God, to Thee. [Refrain]


3 Then, with my waking thoughts bright with Thy praise,

Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise;

So by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee. [Refrain]


4 Or, if on joyful wing cleaving the sky,

Sun, moon, and stars forgot, upward I'll fly,

Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee. [Refrain]


5 There in my Father's home, safe and at rest,

There in my Savior's love, perfectly blest;

Age after age to be nearer, my God, to Thee. [Refrain]
