1 Now, my soul, thy voice upraising,

Tell in sweet and mournful strain,

How the Crucified enduring

Grief, and wounds, and dying pain,

Freely of His love was offered,

Sinless was for sinners slain.


2 Scourged with unrelenting fury,

For the sins which we deplore,

By His livid stripes He heals us,

Raising us to fall no more;

All our bruises gently soothing,

Binding up the bleeding sore.


3 See! His hands and feet are fastened;

So He makes His people free;

Not a wound whence blood is flowing

But a fount of grace shall be;

Yea, the very nails which nail Him

Nail us also to the tree.


4 Through His heart the spear is piercing,

Though His foes have seen Him die;

Blood and water thence are streaming

In a tide of mystery;

Water from our guilt to cleanse us,

Blood to win us crowns on high.


5 Jesu, may those precious fountains

Drink to thirsting souls afford:

Let them be our present healing,

And at length our great reward;

So a ransomed world shall ever

Praise Thee, its redeeming Lord.


Amen.
