1 See, the Conqueror mounts in triumph;

See the King in royal state,

Riding on the clouds, His chariot,

To His heavenly palace gate;

Hark! the choirs of angel voices

Joyful alleluias sing,

And the portals high are lifted

To receive their heavenly King.


2 Who is this that comes in glory,

With the trump of jubilee?

Lord of battles, God of armies,

He hath gained the victory;

He who on the cross did suffer,

He who from the grave arose,

He has vanquished sin and Satan,

He by death has spoiled His foes.


3 While He raised His hands in blessing,

He was parted from His friends;

While their eager eyes behold Him,

He upon the clouds ascends;

He who walked with God and pleased Him,

Preaching truth and doom to come,

Christ, our Enoch, is translated

To His everlasting home.


4 Now our heavenly Aaron enters,

With His blood, within the veil;

Joshua now is come to Canaan,

And the kings before Him quail;

Now He plants the tribes of Israel

In their promised resting-place;

Now our great Elijah offers

Double portion of His grace.


5 Thou hast raised our human nature

In the clouds to God's right hand;

There we sit in heavenly places,

There with Thee in glory stand:

Jesus reigns, adored by angels,

Man with God is on the throne;

Mighty Lord, in Thine ascension,

We by faith behold our own.


Amen.
