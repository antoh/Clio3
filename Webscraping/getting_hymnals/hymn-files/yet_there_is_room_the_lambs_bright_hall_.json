O enter, enter now.\n\r\n\n2 Day is declining, and the sun is low;\n\r\nThe shadows lengthen, light makes haste to go:\n\r\nRoom, room, still room! O enter, enter now.\n\r\n\n3 The bridal hall is filling for the feast;\n\r\nPass in, pass in, and be the Bridegroom's guest:\n\r\nRoom, room, still room! O enter, enter now.\n\r\n\n4 It fills, it fills, that hall of jubilee!\n\r\nMake haste, make haste, 'tis not too full for thee:\n\r\nRoom, room, still room! O enter, enter now.\n\r\n\n5 Yet there is room: still open stands the gate,\n\r\nThe gate of love; it is not yet too late:\n\r\nRoom, room, still room! O enter, enter now.\n\r\n\n6 O enter in; that banquet is for thee;\n\r\nThat cup of everlasting joy is free:\n\r\nRoom, room, still room! O enter, enter now.\n\r\n\n7 All heaven is there, all joy! Go in, go in;\n\r\nThe angels beckon thee the prize to win:\n\r\nRoom, room, still room! O enter, enter now.\n\r\n\n8 Louder and sweeter sounds the loving call;\n\r\nCome, lingerer, come; enter that festal hall:\n\r\nRoom, room, still room! O enter, enter now.\n\r\n\n9 Ere night that gate may close, and seal thy doom;\n\r\nThen the last low, long cry, \"No room, no room!\"\n\r\nNo room, no room! O woeful cry, \"No room!\"\n\r\n\nAmen.","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1895","classifications":"Gender Neutral"}]
