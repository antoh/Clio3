With us, when the storm is sweeping\n\r\nO'er our pathway dark and drear;\n\r\nWaking hope within our bosoms,\n\r\nStilling ev'ry anxious fear:\n\r\nWith us, in the lonely valley,\n\r\nWhen we cross the chilling stream;\n\r\nLighting up the steps to glory,\n\r\nWith salvation's radiant beam.","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1929","classifications":"Gender Neutral,Non-Archaic"}]
