Holy Ghost, the Infinite,\n\r\nShine upon our nature's night\n\r\nWith Thy blessed holy light,\n\r\nComforter Divine.\n\r\n\n2. We are sinful, cleanse us, Lord;\n\r\nWe are faint, Thy strength afford;\n\r\nLost, until by Thee restored,\n\r\nComforter Divine.\n\r\n\n3. Like the dew, Thy peace distil;\n\r\nGuide, subdue our wayward will,\n\r\nThings of Christ unfolding still,\n\r\nComforter Divine.\n\r\n\n4. In us, for us, intercede,\n\r\nAnd with voiceless groanings plead\n\r\nOur unutterable need,\n\r\nComforter Divine.\n\r\n\n5. In us \"Abba, Father,\" cry,\n\r\nEarnest of our bliss on high,\n\r\nSeal of immortality,\n\r\nComforter Divine.\n\r\n\n6. Search for us the depths of God;\n\r\nLead us by the narrow road\n\r\nTo the height of Thine abode,\n\r\nComforter Divine.","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1929","classifications":"Gender Neutral"}]
