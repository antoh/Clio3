[{"title":"Songs and Hymns of the Earliest Greek Christian Poets","hymnalID":"SHEG","number":"19","text":"The first Eternal Mind was law to all,\n\r\nAnd did the Universe to being call:\n\r\nNext, of the First-born forth was chaos spread\n\r\nAnd thirdly, soul on task of labour sped:\n\r\nBut it in vesture thin, and slight array,\n\r\nO'ercome with toil, to death becomes a prey.\n\r\nAt one time regnant it beholds the light;\n\r\nThen soon laments, cast down in piteous plight.\n\r\n'Tis hazard all: now joy, now grief, befalls;\n\r\nAnd now it dies, and now fresh life recalls.\n\r\nIn never-ending labyrinth of woes\n\r\nIt, wretched, hither now, now hither goes.\n\r\nThen Jesus spake: On earth, O Father, see\n\r\nHow things have strayed in dire perplexity\n\r\nFar from Thy Breath: how floods of evil roll,\n\r\nAnd in base matter overwhelm the soul!\n\r\nEscape it seeks from bitter woe all round,\n\r\nBut knows not where a passage may be found.\n\r\nO Father, Me upon this errand send:\n\r\nBearing Thy seals, I will the depths descend;\n\r\nThroughout whole ages I will make my way,\n\r\nAll mysteries of darkness turn to day;\n\r\nAnd godlike forms I thenceforth will display:\n\r\nForth Knowledge I will call to quell all strife,\n\r\nAnd upward show the holy paths of life.\n\r\n\n","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1876","classifications":"Gender Neutral"}]
