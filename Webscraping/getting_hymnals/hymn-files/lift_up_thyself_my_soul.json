(1-11).\n\r\nLift up thyself, my soul,\n\r\nAbove this world's control!\n\r\nSpend and be spent in holy hymns of praise:\n\r\nBe armed with pure desire,\n\r\nBurn with celestial fire:\n\r\nUnto the King of gods our voice we raise:\n\r\nTo Him a crown we weave, and bring\n\r\nA sacrifice of words, a bloodless offering.\n\r\n\nII. (11-22).\n\r\n20\n\r\nThee on the troubled deep,\n\r\nThee o'er the islands steep,\n\r\nThee through the mighty continents of land,\n\r\nThee in the city's throng,\n\r\nOr mountain tops along,\n\r\nOr when in celebrated plains I stand,\n\r\nThee, Thee, O blessed One, I sing,\n\r\nThee, Thee, O Father of the world, Eternal King!\n\r\n\nIII. (23-36).\n\r\nThy praise I hymn by night,\n\r\nThy praise at morning light,\n\r\nThy praise by day, Thy praise at eventide.\n\r\nThis know the hoary stars,\n\r\nAnd moon with silver bars,\n\r\nAnd chiefly he that doth on high preside\n\r\nO'er all the host of heaven, the sun,\n\r\nWho measuring time for holy souls his course doth run.\n\r\n\nIV. (37-50).\n\r\n21\n\r\nFain to thy folds I sped,\n\r\nAnd to Thy bosom fled,\n\r\nWinging my steps from Matter's wide-spread rule:\n\r\nNow on famed mountain peak,\n\r\nThy face alone to seek;\n\r\nNow on the plain I hailed thy vestibule.\n\r\nA suppliant thus to many a shrine\n\r\nOf sacred rites I came, and mysteries divine.\n\r\n\nV. (51-67).\n\r\nAnd now to southern land,\n\r\nAnd Libya's desert strand\n\r\nI roamed, where neither godless spirit reigns,\n\r\nNor teeming cities' strife\n\r\nCalls men to busy life;\n\r\nThat so my soul, from woeful toils and pains\n\r\nAnd passions' war and groans set free,\n\r\nAnd all the ills of fate, might harmonize with Thee.\n\r\n\nVI. (68-75).\n\r\n22\n\r\nAnd might, in blest relief,\n\r\nUnshackled now from grief,\n\r\nWith lips and tongue all cleansed, and hallowed mind,\n\r\nRepay the hymn to Thee,\n\r\nThe hymn full due from me.\n\r\nBe Earth and Ether holily combined\n\r\nAnd Air and Sea with one accord\n\r\nBe still, and join in adoration to the Lord!\n\r\n\nVII. (76-85).\n\r\nSwift breath of winds, be still,\n\r\nAnd whirling pool and rill,\n\r\nAnd floods that are at rivers' mouths forth hurled;\n\r\nAnd streams from fountain-heads\n\r\nThat rush down rocky beds:\n\r\nAnd hushed be ye, deep hollows of the world;\n\r\nWhile breath in holy hymns is spent,\n\r\nAnd sacrifice of praise in upward strains is sent.\n\r\n\nVIII. (86-94).\n\r\n23\n\r\nDown sink the serpent's trail!\n\r\nNor let their craft prevail!\n\r\nDown sink the wing&#232;d dragon underground;\n\r\nWho loves to cloud the soul,\n\r\nThe god who doth control\n\r\nThis lower world, and idol-worship found,\n\r\nAnd urgeth on the dogs of hell\n\r\nAgainst God's praying people, His true Israel!\n\r\n\nIX. (95-107).\n\r\nO bless&#232;d Father, Friend,\n\r\nMy soul do Thou defend.\n\r\nFrom soul-devouring dogs; defend my prayer,\n\r\nDefend my deeds, my life,\n\r\nFrom their destructive strife\n\r\nAnd charge Thy holy angels, that they bear\n\r\nTo Thee this offering of my mind:\n\r\nFor hymns they carry that with Thee acceptance find.\n\r\n\nX. (108-117).\n\r\n24\n\r\nNow am I borne along\n\r\nTo lists of sacred song:\n\r\nNow holy words in streams spontaneous flow:\n\r\nA voice within me rings,\n\r\nAnd toucheth my heart-strings:\n\r\nBut unto me, O Father, mercy show;\n\r\nForgive, O Bless&#232;d, if I stray,\n\r\nIn theme divine, and miss the rightful ordered way.\n\r\n\nXI. (118-125).\n\r\nWhat eye can steadfast gaze,\n\r\nWhen Thy dread beacons blaze?\n\r\nWhat eye so wise, so strong, of mortal man,\n\r\nThat it unclosed may bear\n\r\nThy vivid lightning's glare?\n\r\nE'en of the mighty ones on high none can,\n\r\nHowever strong, however bold,\n\r\nThe glorious brightness of Thy Majesty behold.\n\r\n\nXII. (126-137).\n\r\n25\n\r\nNow aims the mind too far,\n\r\nAnd finds repelling bar,\n\r\nNor can it penetrate by utmost strain\n\r\nThe depths so dazzling bright,\n\r\nWhere Thou dost dwell in light:\n\r\nSo, falling back from efforts feebly vain,\n\r\nIt courts within its proper scope\n\r\nAn object known whereon to fix the eye of hope;\n\r\n\nXIII. (138-146).\n\r\nThat for Thy hymns it might\n\r\nThence pluck fair flowers of light,\n\r\nNor leave to thankless winds an offering:\n\r\nBut render back to Thee\n\r\nThine own, for Thine they be;\n\r\nFor what of all things is not Thine, O King?\n\r\nO Father of all fathers, Thou!\n\r\nTo Thine eternal Fatherhood all beings bow!\n\r\n\nXIV. (147-157).\n\r\n26\n\r\nBut Father Thou hadst none;\n\r\nThou art the self-sprung One,\n\r\nBefore all worlds the sole great Mind existing:\n\r\nGerm of whate'er we see,\n\r\nSpur of all things that be\n\r\nRoot of first worlds, by Thee alone subsisting:\n\r\nLight of all light, Truth's basis sure;\n\r\nAnd Wisdom's everflowing stream, and fountain pure.\n\r\n\nXV. (158-165).\n\r\nO Mind immutable!\n\r\nO Light inscrutable!\n\r\nThine is the eye that guides the lightning fire:\n\r\nIn Thee the ages live,\n\r\nThou dost their limits give;\n\r\nWho can Thy praises reach, Eternal Sire?\n\r\nThou art beyond the dreams of men;\n\r\nBeyond the reach of mind, or highest angel's ken.\n\r\n\nXVI. (166-173).\n\r\n27\n\r\nO'er all Thy rule is spread,\n\r\nThe living and the dead;\n\r\nTo minds that be, the parent Mind Thou art;\n\r\nAll heaven Thou dost control,\n\r\nThou nourishest the soul,\n\r\nAnd dost to spirit energy impart;\n\r\nThe Spring Thou art whence all things flow,\n\r\nAnd from eternity the Root whence all things grow.\n\r\n\nXVII. (174-183).\n\r\nThe only One, yet all;\n\r\nIn Thee all numbers fall;\n\r\nThe only One, yet countless evermore:\n\r\nThe self-existent Mind,\n\r\nYet mind with law combined;\n\r\nMind's realm, yet all the realm of mind before:\n\r\nThrough all, yet all beyond, art Thou:\n\r\nTo Thee, the Seed of all existing things, we bow.\n\r\n\nXVIII. (184-190).\n\r\n28\n\r\nThou art the Eternal Root,\n\r\nThou art the spreading Shoot!\n\r\nOr male or female Thou be called, 'tis one;\n\r\nTo mind Thou nature art,\n\r\nAnd dost Thyself impart,\n\r\nBut mind enlightened ne'er can say, 'tis done;\n\r\nBut here and there a word outpours,\n\r\nWhile feebly it the unfathomed depth around explores.\n\r\n\nXIX. (191-198).\n\r\nThou art the Parent Tree,\n\r\nAll have their life from Thee,\n\r\nOr stem or branch, whatever is, is Thine.\n\r\nThou art the Light of light,\n\r\nThe Light of day so bright,\n\r\nThe Light that shineth evermore Divine:\n\r\nThou art, again, the hidden Light,\n\r\nBy its own glory hidden far from mortal sight.\n\r\n\nXX. (199-209).\n\r\n29\n\r\nYet one, yet all, one Lord,\n\r\nOne only, yet forth poured,\n\r\nThrough all forth poured in holy Mystery:\n\r\nOf Thee thus sprung the Son,\n\r\nWisdom, the glorious One,\n\r\nCreator of the universe to be.\n\r\nThe Godhead severed into twain\n\r\nBy birth ineffable, unsevered doth remain.\n\r\n\nXXI. (210-216).\n\r\nYet One, though Twain, though Three:\n\r\nMysterious Trinity!\n\r\nFor Thou art One in Three, and Three in One.\n\r\nI sing Thee, Unity!\n\r\nI sing Thee, Trinity!\n\r\nThe Triune King, the Father, Spirit, Son!\n\r\nThe Light divided is not spent,\n\r\nThe One pervading mind, though parted, is not rent.\n\r\n\nXXII. (217-224).\n\r\n30\n\r\nThy holy Will is done,\n\r\n'Tis through the Eternal Son;\n\r\nAnd from the outpoured Godhead forth there springs,\n\r\nWhich cannot be exprest\n\r\nIn words, the Spirit Blest,\n\r\nThe Uncreated! we of wondrous things\n\r\nHave spoken; but we speak not there:\n\r\nWe dare not if we could, we could not if we dare.\n\r\n\nXXIII. (225-231).\n\r\nWho knows the Eternal Laws?\n\r\nWho knows the First Great Cause?\n\r\nWe may not say a Second, or a Third.\n\r\nO Birth beyond our reach;\n\r\nO Spring defying speech!\n\r\nWhat mortal to the task himself could gird?\n\r\nO matchless Holy One, between\n\r\nThe Father and the Son Thy Light doth intervene.\n\r\n\nXXIV. (232-240).\n\r\n31\n\r\nAll reverence to Thee,\n\r\nEternal Spirit, be!\n\r\nThou of the Three the middle rank dost hold.\n\r\nAnd now, most glorious Son,\n\r\nThy praises be begun!\n\r\nThy birth, thy generation, is untold:\n\r\nThe Father's Son, the Father's Will,\n\r\nWith Him Thou present wast, and present Thou art still.\n\r\n\nXXV. (241-253)\n\r\nThou with the Father art,\n\r\nAnd ever next His heart;\n\r\nNor can deep flowing Time Thy birth reveal;\n\r\nNor aged Aeon say\n\r\nWhen was Thy natal day;\n\r\nHe never learned, nor could remove the seal.\n\r\nSon with the Father! He the same\n\r\nWho should hereafter give to Aeon birth and name.\n\r\n\nXXVI. (254-265).\n\r\n32\n\r\nWho hath adjudged the eye\n\r\nInto God's depths to pry?\n\r\nThe subtle tongue will dare, but man is blind.\n\r\nSuch daring is in vain,\n\r\n'Tis godless, and profane.\n\r\nThou dost to Thine pour light upon the mind,\n\r\nAnd guard their hearts with holy care,\n\r\nThat they in darkness sink not through gross matter's snare.\n\r\n\nXXVII. (266-275).\n\r\nTo Thee all holy praise\n\r\nIt well befits to raise;\n\r\nFor Thou of all art Father, all are Thine:\n\r\nThou all the worlds didst found,\n\r\nThou dost all ages bound,\n\r\nThou framedst all the host of heaven divine;\n\r\nTo Thee all minds of light do sing,\n\r\nAnd starry spheres intelligent hail thee their King!\n\r\n\nXXVIII. (276-285).\n\r\n33\n\r\nWhile round in holy choir\n\r\nDance their bright orbs of fire,\n\r\nThe blest ones all do shout and sing before Thee;\n\r\nThe world within, around,\n\r\nThey all Thy praise resound,\n\r\nAll in their stations evermore adore Thee:\n\r\nThose in the zones; and those outside,\n\r\nWho yet their several posts assigned in wisdom guide.\n\r\n\nXXIX. (286-300).\n\r\nThese come to guard, or tame,\n\r\nEarth's helmsmen, sons of fame;\n\r\nOf link angelic, and who draw their birth\n\r\nFrom old heroic race;\n\r\nWho ever take their place,\n\r\nBy hidden ways, o'er men and things of earth:\n\r\nAnd though of an unyielding will,\n\r\nTo dark-rayed worldly glories ever yield they still.\n\r\n\nXXX. (301-311).\n\r\n34\n\r\nTo Thee blithe nature sings,\n\r\nAnd all from her that springs:\n\r\nFor Thou with heavenly breath dost them renew,\n\r\nForth pouring from above\n\r\nThy stores of grace and love,\n\r\nWhich ever fresh descend in showers and dew;\n\r\nThou to all nature nature art,\n\r\nO Lord of worlds unstained! and dost Thine own impart.\n\r\n\nXXXI. (312-319).\n\r\nFor nature Thou didst train\n\r\nAnd school, that she again\n\r\nMight parent be of every mortal thing;\n\r\nThe faithful counterpart\n\r\nOf all that Thyself art,\n\r\nOf life and health the everflowing spring!\n\r\nThat to the world's extremest bound\n\r\nEach part in turn with living beauty might be crowned.\n\r\n\nXXXII. (320-328).\n\r\n35\n\r\nFor it were never right\n\r\nThat things should jar and fight,\n\r\nOr dregs of earth with excellence contend;\n\r\nBut all by Thy decree\n\r\nIs wrought in harmony;\n\r\nNor aught shall perish, nor the chorus end;\n\r\nBut each from other takes its share,\n\r\nAnd all through one another taste Thy loving care.\n\r\n\nXXXIII. (329-334).\n\r\nThe eternal wheel revolves,\n\r\nAnd the dark riddle solves;\n\r\nThings die; Thou sendest forth Thy breath, they live,\n\r\nAnd in fresh glory bloom,\n\r\nRenewed from mortal doom.\n\r\nThus nurtured nature nurturing doth give;\n\r\nAnd she doth sing a deathless song\n\r\nTo Thee by all her children through the ages long.\n\r\n\nXXXIV. (335-342).\n\r\n36\n\r\nIn colour or in skin,\n\r\nWithout, or life within,\n\r\nAnd deeds, however varied they may be,\n\r\nYet nature moulds them all\n\r\nObedient to her call;\n\r\nAnd links them fast in holy unity;\n\r\nAnd from all creatures thus doth raise\n\r\nOf differing voices one harmonious hymn of praise.\n\r\n\nXXXV. (343-357).\n\r\nTo Thee, their Lord and King,\n\r\nAll things their tribute bring\n\r\nOf ceaseless praise; the night, the morn, the sky,\n\r\nThe lightning flash, the snow,\n\r\nAnd things that spring and grow;\n\r\nAll bodies and all spirits; birds that fly,\n\r\nAnd beasts that graze; seeds, plants, and roots;\n\r\nThe sea with all that swims, and earth with all her fruits.\n\r\n\nXXXVI. (358-367).\n\r\n37\n\r\nThe waves of trouble roll;\n\r\nLook Thou upon my soul,\n\r\nTo act so powerless, to learn so slow,\n\r\nWhere on Thy Libyan sands\n\r\nThe mystic temple stands;\n\r\nFor hither I, Thy holy will to know,\n\r\nOppressed with grief, my steps have bent,\n\r\nOn prayer and supplication unto Thee intent.\n\r\n\nXXXVII. (368-374).\n\r\nBefore Thy favouring eye\n\r\nEarth's gloomy vapours fly:\n\r\nLook Thou on me, and bid my sorrows cease.\n\r\n'Tis so! e'en now my heart\n\r\nThrough food Thy hymns impart--\n\r\nFor Thine they are--hath nourishment of peace,\n\r\nAnd points my mind with keen desire\n\r\nTo rise afresh to thoughts and words of heavenly fire.\n\r\n\nXXXVIII. (375-380).\n\r\n38\n\r\nBut send, O King, Thy light,\n\r\nTo quicken my dull sight,\n\r\nAnd guide me on the road that leads to Thee.\n\r\nAnd, Father, grant, I pray,\n\r\nThat from the body's sway\n\r\nMy better part, escaping, may be free,\n\r\nAnd not again be downward hurled\n\r\nBeneath the floods and eddies of this troubled world.\n\r\n\nXXXIX. (381-391).\n\r\nYet here, while in the strife\n\r\nOf world-enchain&#232;d life,\n\r\nO Bless&#232;d, may kind fortune smile on me;\n\r\nNor stormy tempest blow\n\r\nTo check the holy glow,\n\r\nOr rudely break the mind's tranquillity;\n\r\nLest inrush of the worldly flood\n\r\nShould leave to me no leisure for the things of God.\n\r\n\nXL. (392-400).\n\r\n39\n\r\nAnd whereto I have striven,\n\r\nBy grace which Thou hast given,\n\r\n(For all good gifts of help and strength are Thine),\n\r\nMay I the ground retain,\n\r\nNor e'er fall back again.\n\r\nFor which Thy gifts this humble wreath of mine\n\r\nFrom holy fields to Thee I bring,\n\r\nO Thou of all creations pure the Eternal King;\n\r\n\nXLI. (402-409).\n\r\nTo Thee and to Thy Son,\n\r\nThine own, the only One,\n\r\nAlone of Thee begotten, the All-wise,\n\r\nWhom from eternity\n\r\nThou hadst, and hast, with Thee,\n\r\nThough forth from Thee He came to harmonize\n\r\nAll things, and fashion, form, and guide,\n\r\nBy wisdom's breath outpoured, and over all preside.\n\r\n\nXLII. (410-416).\n\r\n40\n\r\nThe hoary ages wake,\n\r\nAnd their due course take,\n\r\nAt his command; and of His matchless skill,\n\r\nAnd workmanship divine,\n\r\nAs if by plumb and line,\n\r\nThis rugged world He mouldeth to His will,\n\r\nWhate'er exists above the ground,\n\r\nOr on its surface, or within its depths profound.\n\r\n\nXLIII. (417-427).\n\r\nAnd merciful and kind\n\r\nHe shines with holy mind\n\r\nOn toiling mortals; and doth bring relief;\n\r\nFor He doth loose the chain\n\r\nOf toilsome care and pain;\n\r\nEffects their good, and drives away their grief.\n\r\nThe God who did the world create,\n\r\nWhat marvel that His own He guard from whelming fate?\n\r\n\nXLIV. (428-440).\n\r\n41\n\r\nAnd hither southward now,\n\r\nThat I might pay this vow\n\r\nTo Thee the mighty world's eternal guide,\n\r\nI came from northern Thrace,\n\r\nWhere three years' dreary space\n\r\nNear the Imperial Court I did abide,\n\r\nIn toil, with tears and anguish sore,\n\r\nFor on my shoulders I my mother country bore,\n\r\n\nXLV. (441-454).\n\r\nAnd well Thou know'st, good Lord,\n\r\nHow from my limbs was poured\n\r\nA sweat of agony from day to day:\n\r\nNor rest had I by night\n\r\nIn that dire mental fight:\n\r\nBut watered was the couch on which I lay\n\r\nFrom streaming eyes. Then to and fro,\n\r\nTo every shrine a suppliant I made haste to go.\n\r\n\nXLVI. (455-462).\n\r\n42\n\r\nTo all in turn I bring\n\r\nPrayer, chaplet, offering,\n\r\nAnd water with my tears each sacred floor,\n\r\nThat I might not with pain\n\r\nHave journey made in vain,\n\r\nBut that Thou wouldst wide-open hopeful door.\n\r\nThus in my own and country's need\n\r\nI with Thy holy ones through fruitful Thrace did plead;\n\r\n\nXLVII. (463-473).\n\r\nAnd who across the main,\n\r\nGuard Carthaginian plain,\n\r\nI sought them all, if they might succour me,\n\r\nThroughout the region round,\n\r\nWhom Thou with rays hadst crowned\n\r\nAngelic, Thine attendant saints to be.\n\r\nThe blest ones helped my eager prayers,\n\r\nThey helped my many toils, and soothed my many cares.\n\r\n\nXLVIII. (474-489).\n\r\n43\n\r\nLife did no pleasure yield,\n\r\nWhile my poor country reeled\n\r\nHalf stunned: but Thou hast righted her, O King!\n\r\nThe Rock of Ages Thou,\n\r\nTo whom the world doth bow!\n\r\nCrushed were my limbs, my soul a lifeless thing:\n\r\nBut Thou from Heaven hast breathed at length\n\r\nNew vigour on my soul, and on my limbs new strength.\n\r\n\nXLIX. (490-497).\n\r\nFor Thou hast-brought relief,\n\r\nAnd stayed o'erflowing grief:\n\r\nToils have an end, the wearied soul hath rest.\n\r\n'Twas by Thy wisdom planned,\n\r\n'Twas wrought out by Thy hand.\n\r\nThou to my mind hast given refreshment blest.\n\r\nNow, O my God, do Thou ordain,\n\r\nThat to the Libyans these Thine own sweet gifts remain;\n\r\n\nL. (498-505).\n\r\n44\n\r\nOf our long tribulation,\n\r\nOf Thy so great Salvation,\n\r\nA lasting record! Hear Thy suppliant's prayer;\n\r\nAnd henceforth may my life\n\r\nBe safe from harmful strife.\n\r\nLoose me from toil, disease, and deadly care.\n\r\nThus to Thy servant bow Thine ear,\n\r\nAnd grant my mental life be ever bright and clear.\n\r\n\nLI. (506-523).\n\r\nI would not showers of wealth\n\r\nTo try the soul's best health,\n\r\nAnd leave no leisure for the things divine;\n\r\nNor poverty would I,\n\r\nWith downcast sullen eye,\n\r\nBlack spectre to the house, prone to repine,\n\r\nBowed down to earth with earthly cares.\n\r\nBoth grovel on the ground, and both are dangerous snares.\n\r\n\nLII. (524-532).\n\r\n45\n\r\nAnd both forgetful are\n\r\nOf better things by far,\n\r\nThe mind, and all that to the mind doth cling,\n\r\nUnless, O heavenly Friend,\n\r\nThou shouldst Thy help extend.\n\r\nYea, Father, wisdom's holy self and spring,\n\r\nUpon this faltering soul of mine\n\r\nThe light of mind from Thine own bosom cause to shine.\n\r\n\nLIII. (533-543).\n\r\nAnd on my heart, I pray,\n\r\nTurn Thou blest wisdom's ray,\n\r\nWith helping hand, and point the holy road\n\r\nThat leadeth unto Thee;\n\r\nAnd set Thy seal on me,\n\r\nAnd let me have the token of my God;\n\r\nAnd from my life, and from my prayer,\n\r\nDrive earthly demons of presumption and despair.\n\r\n\nLIV. (544-553).\n\r\n46\n\r\nAnd may my body be\n\r\nFrom all dishonour free,\n\r\nAs fortress unassailable to foe;\n\r\nAnd may my spirit pure\n\r\nUnto the end endure\n\r\nBy Thine all-saving help. Full well I know,\n\r\nThat I do bear dark worldly stain,\n\r\nAnd held in bondage am by earthly passions' chain;\n\r\n\nLV. (544-563).\n\r\nBut Thou deliverer art,\n\r\nAnd cleanser of the heart.\n\r\nFrom evils circling round escape afford,\n\r\nAnd from diseases all,\n\r\nAnd bonds that fret and gall.\n\r\nI bear Thy seed, of noble mind, good Lord,\n\r\nA spark that issued forth from Thee,\n\r\nAnd flashing down through depths of matter lit on me.\n\r\n\nLVI. (564-574).\n\r\n47\n\r\nFor in the world, O King,\n\r\nThou mad'st a soul to spring,\n\r\nAnd in the body, through the soul, a mind:\n\r\nO pity then Thine own,\n\r\nThe handmaid from Thy throne:\n\r\nFrom Thee descending, hapless I did bind\n\r\nMyself as labourer free to earth:\n\r\nNot labourer now, but slave, downfallen from my birth.\n\r\n\nLVII. (575-585).\n\r\nFor, me the world around\n\r\nWith witchery hath bound,\n\r\nSome little strength may yet remain in me\n\r\nOf secret inner light,\n\r\nNot yet extinguished quite:\n\r\nBut o'er my head is rolled a mighty sea,\n\r\nThat doth make blind the mental eye\n\r\nThat would its God and things of heavenly worth descry.\n\r\n\nLVIII. (586-592).\n\r\n48\n\r\nO look with pitying eye,\n\r\nAnd hear the mournful cry\n\r\nOf Thine own child, O Father good and kind:\n\r\nWhom oft when she would rise\n\r\nUp to her native skies,\n\r\nImpelled by holy efforts of the mind,\n\r\nYet fascination of this world\n\r\nHath choked, and back to earth's dark mazes hurled.\n\r\n\nLIX. (593-602).\n\r\nBut O! send forth Thy light,\n\r\nA beacon fire through night,\n\r\nTo guide' and cheer me on my upward way;\n\r\nAnd may that seed take root,\n\r\nAnd, striking out its shoot\n\r\nFrom small beginning, bead of flower display.\n\r\nO Father, such Thy help divine,\n\r\nEnthrone me in the light of life above to shine;\n\r\n\nLX. (603-611).\n\r\n49\n\r\nWhere nature cannot clasp\n\r\nWith her resistless grasp:\n\r\nAnd whence no longer earth, or web of fate,\n\r\nCan back recall to woe\n\r\nAnd vain desires below.\n\r\nLet brood deceitful that I scorn and hate\n\r\nOf worldly passions scattered be,\n\r\nAnd leave thy servant, O my God, at peace with Thee!\n\r\n\nLXI. (612-627).\n\r\nMe and earth's din betwixt\n\r\nBe fiery barrier fixed.\n\r\nThy grace, O Father, to my soul reveal;\n\r\nAnd let thy suppliant find,\n\r\nWith outspread wings of mind,\n\r\nThe ascending path, and bear aloft Thy seal,\n\r\nA terror to the up-springing foe,\n\r\nWho breathe to mortals godless thoughts from depths below;\n\r\n\nLXII. (628-635).\n\r\n50\n\r\nBut badge and token known\n\r\nTo those about Thy throne,\n\r\nThe holy ones, who all the heights survey\n\r\nOf Thy bright world, and stand\n\r\nAs guards in high command,\n\r\nBearing the keys of upward fiery way,\n\r\nThat they may give an entrance free,\n\r\nAnd open wide the gates of heavenly light to me.\n\r\n\nLXIII. (636-645),\n\r\nBut still while creeping here\n\r\nUpon this empty sphere\n\r\nOf earth, yet not of earth grant me to be;\n\r\nBut from a better root\n\r\nE'en here attesting fruit\n\r\nTo bear of fire-proved deeds, my God, to Thee;\n\r\nAnd Thy true voice to hear and know,\n\r\nAnd whate'er warms and makes in souls blest hope to grow.\n\r\n\nLXIV. (646-653).\n\r\n51\n\r\nIt doth me now repent\n\r\nOf life on earth ill-spent:\n\r\nBegone, the blear-eyed haze of godless men,\n\r\nAnd built-up cities' strength\n\r\nBegone, ye breadth and length\n\r\nOf worldly aims, nor harass me again,\n\r\nYe sweet calamities, ye toys\n\r\nOf mighty seeming, bootless boons, and joyless joys.\n\r\n\nLXV. (654-661).\n\r\nTranced by your bravery\n\r\nThe soul in slavery\n\r\nTo earth is held; and wretched is indeed;\n\r\nFor of her own good things\n\r\nThis cup oblivion brings:\n\r\nAnd things, wherewith to satisfy her need\n\r\nShe hoped, are forthwith snatched away;\n\r\nAnd from vain dream she wakes to envy's shaft a prey.\n\r\n\nLXVI. (662-670).\n\r\n52\n\r\nFor fortune here below\n\r\nA double face doth show,\n\r\nFalse queen: whom if you haply win and trust,\n\r\nAnd in her livery shine,\n\r\nAnd at her table dine,\n\r\nSoon rue your lot with bitter tears you must,\n\r\nWhen down from pedestal so high\n\r\nYou fall in widespread ruin, and neglected lie.\n\r\n\nLXVII. (672-683).\n\r\nFor here, from adverse sides,\n\r\nNow good, now ill, betides:\n\r\nTo mortals such is life's necessity.\n\r\nTo God, or what hath birth\n\r\nFrom God, but not to earth,\n\r\nIs good unmingled with adversity.\n\r\nDid cup of sweets intoxicate?\n\r\nEnsnared I learnt by crop of woes a lesson late.\n\r\n\nLXVIII. (684-693).\n\r\n53\n\r\nI hate these laws of change\n\r\nAnd hence now upward range,\n\r\nWith wings expanded, to the peaceful sky:\n\r\nTo bright ethereal plains,\n\r\nWhere my dear Father reigns,\n\r\nFrom earth, and earths two-sided gifts I fly.\n\r\nO Steward of the life of mind,\n\r\nTo Thee I look; with Thee may I acceptance find.\n\r\n\nLXIX. (694-703).\n\r\nMy soul doth hang on Thee:\n\r\nHeed Thou Thy suppliant's plea,\n\r\nBound here on earth, yet struggling to ascend\n\r\nThe upward paths of mind:\n\r\nAs Thou thus far hast shined,\n\r\nO shine yet more: light wings of succour lend\n\r\nSnap double passions' bond, and chain\n\r\nOf earth unloose, and let my soul her freedom gain.\n\r\n\nLXX. (704-713).\n\r\n54\n\r\nFor nature by these chains\n\r\nHer treacherous power obtains,\n\r\nAnd binds me down to earth a helpless prey;\n\r\nBut from the body freed,\n\r\nAnd all its direful need,\n\r\nGrant me to take swift flight to realms of day,\n\r\nTo Thine own halls and Thine own breast,\n\r\nWhence flows the Fountain of the soul; and be at rest.\n\r\n\nLXXI. (714-725).\n\r\nA drop from Fountain Head\n\r\nPoured, forth, to earth I sped,\n\r\nAn exile and a wanderer from Thee;\n\r\nMe now, I pray, restore\n\r\nTo where I was before:\n\r\nWith light ancestral may I mingled be!\n\r\nTune Thou my mind with Thine own choir\n\r\nIn holiness to sing the hymns Thou dost inspire.\n\r\n\nLXXII. (726-734).\n\r\n55\n\r\nOnce saved from mortal plight,\n\r\nOnce mingled with the light,\n\r\nO Father, grant I never enter more\n\r\nWithin earth's black domains\n\r\nOf penalties and pains;\n\r\nBut while I yet am chained to this dark shore,\n\r\nAnd bear life's drudgery below,\n\r\nBid Thou that fortune's breezes on me gently blow.\n\r\n\n","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1876","classifications":null}]
