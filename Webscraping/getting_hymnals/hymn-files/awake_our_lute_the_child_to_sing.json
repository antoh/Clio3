[{"title":"Songs and Hymns of the Earliest Greek Christian Poets","hymnalID":"SHEG","number":"5","text":"Awake, our lute, the child to sing\n\r\nOf bride unwedded, holy maid;\n\r\nTrue Son of the Eternal King,\n\r\nEre earth's foundations yet were laid.\n\r\n\nIneffable Thy counsels, Lord,\n\r\nFather of all, by which was born\n\r\nThe Christ! a virgin's throes afford\n\r\nThe Light of Life to world forlorn!\n\r\n\nA Man! and yet of ages gone,\n\r\nAnd of all ages yet to come,\n\r\nThroughout eternity, the One\n\r\nUpholder, Perfecter, and Sum.\n\r\n\nThyself, O Christ, art Fount of Light,\n\r\nLight of the Father's Light, bright Ray!\n\r\nDark matter thou didst burst; and night\n\r\nTo holy souls Thou turn'st to day.\n\r\n\nYea! Founder of the world Thou art,\n\r\nAnd moulder of each starry sphere:\n\r\nTo earth her spurs Thou dost impart;\n\r\nWhile men hail Thee their Saviour dear.\n\r\n\nFor Thee his chariot Titan drives,\n\r\nThe quenchless fount of morning light.\n\r\nFrom Thee the bull-faced moon derives\n\r\nHer power to loose the gloom of night.\n\r\n\nBy Thee the year with fruit is crowned:\n\r\nBy Thee the flocks and herds are fed:\n\r\nProductive Thou dost make the ground;\n\r\nAnd to the poor Thou givest bread.\n\r\n\nFor Thou from Thine o'erflowing store\n\r\nOf grace ineffable and love,\n\r\nO'er surface of all worlds dost pour\n\r\nThe fertile sunshine from above.\n\r\n\nAnd from Thy bosom forth did spring\n\r\nTo life both light, and mind, and soul:\n\r\nO pity then Thine own offspring\n\r\nImprisoned under hard control,\n\r\n\nBy mortal limbs, by flesh and blood,\n\r\nCoerced, and measures stern of fate:\n\r\nO save Thine own, Thou great and good,\n\r\nNor let sick mind sick body hate!\n\r\n\nPersuasion to my words nod Thou,\n\r\nAnd to my deeds such honest fame,\n\r\nThat truth I never disavow,\n\r\nNor Sparta nor Cyrene shame!\n\r\n\nBut may my soul, unbowed by grief,\n\r\nDraw all her nourishment from Thee,\n\r\nStretching both eyes, in calm relief,\n\r\nUp to Thy light, from sorrow free!\n\r\n\nThat, cleansed from dregs of worldly soil,\n\r\nI may by straight course upward mount,\n\r\nAnd 'scaping from earth's care and toil,\n\r\nBe mingled with the soul's own fount!\n\r\n\nLife such of pure content and praise,\n\r\nDo Thou to Thy poor harper grant,\n\r\nWhile still to Thee the hymn I raise,\n\r\nAnd glory to the Father chant,\n\r\n\nAnd Spirit, mid-enthroned compeer,\n\r\nThe Parent Root and Branch between!\n\r\nBe such on earth my bright career,\n\r\nNor sin nor sorrow intervene;\n\r\n\nUntil, within the courts above,\n\r\nThe travail of my soul shall cease,\n\r\nStill singing hymns of heavenly love\n\r\nIn glory and in perfect peace.\n\r\n\nThee, Thee, the Fount of love, we bless,\n\r\nO Father, rock and strength of Thine;\n\r\nAnd Thee alike, His form express,\n\r\nAnd seal, all beauty, Son Divine;\n\r\n\nAnd Holy Breath, of both the crown,\n\r\nWhose quickening gifts like billows roll:\n\r\nThou with the Father, send Him down\n\r\nTo cheer and fertilize my soul!\n\r\n\n","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1876","classifications":null}]
