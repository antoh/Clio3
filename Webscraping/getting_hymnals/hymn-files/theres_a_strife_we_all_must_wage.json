Each thought impure\n\nPassions fierce, that tear the soul;\n\nEvery ill that we can cure;\n\nEvery crime we can control;\n\nEvery suffering which our hand\n\nCan with soothing care assuage;\n\nEvery evil of our land;\n\nEvery error of our age.\n\nOn, then, to the glorious field!\n\nHe who dies his life shall save;\n\nGod himself shall be our shield,\n\nHe shall bless and crown the brave.\n\n","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1866","classifications":"Non-Archaic"}]
