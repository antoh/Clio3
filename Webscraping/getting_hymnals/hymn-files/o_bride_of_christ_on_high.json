Adam testifies:\n\r\nFor this on Sinai's peak\n\r\nDoth Moses also speak;\n\r\n128\n\r\nAnd Zachary the priest,\n\r\nOf God's true saints not least,\n\r\n\nAnd whom we hail the rather\n\r\nAs the Forerunner's father.\n\r\nBut marriage hath its need:\n\r\nHence springs a holy seed:\n\r\nAnd hence the virgin bride,\n\r\nHonoured at God's own side.\n\r\nYet of the flesh it is, and earth,\n\r\nAll earthly from its birth.\n\r\nWhen law and shadows ruled,\n\r\nAnd we were sometime schooled,\n\r\n\nMarriage held sceptre mild,\n\r\nYet like a little child.\n\r\nBut when the letter died,\n\r\nThe Spirit was supplied:\n\r\nFor Christ had come and borne\n\r\nIn flesh our woes and scorn:\n\r\nHad brought Redemption nigh,\n\r\nAnd then ascended high:\n\r\nChrist, sprung from Virgin's womb,\n\r\nChrist, Conqueror o'er the tomb.\n\r\nThen continence did rise,\n\r\nAnd this base world despise,\n\r\nWhich should its course have mended,\n\r\nAnd high with Christ ascended.\n\r\n\nThou journey'st well! but haste!\n\r\nBehind is fiery waste:\n\r\nTake to thy steps good heed,\n\r\nAnd to the mountain speed.\n\r\nCast not one backward glance\n\r\nOn Sodom, lest perchance\n\r\n\nThou, fixed upon the ground,\n\r\nA pile of salt be found.\n\r\nIn battling with the flesh\n\r\nTake ever courage fresh,\n\r\nNeither by terror bent,\n\r\nNor over-confident.\n\r\nFaint not, for He is nigh\n\r\nWho will all strength supply.\n\r\n\nA spark may kindle hell:\n\r\nWater the flame cloth quell.\n\r\nFull means to thee are lent\n\r\nFor good self-government.\n\r\nLet thou the fear of God\n\r\nFreeze the rebellious blood:\n\r\nFasting the flesh control:\n\r\nKeep watches o'er thy soul,\n\r\nAnd pour it forth in prayer:\n\r\nSuch thy true weapons are.\n\r\nAdd tears: and lowly bed,\n\r\nWith reeds or rushes spread:\n\r\n\nOne constant flame of love\n\r\nRising to God above,\n\r\nAnd lulling all desire\n\r\nWhich doth not up aspire.\n\r\nThe fallen rise by thee!\n\r\nThe shipwrecked pitied be!\n\r\nThyself live out the gale,\n\r\nExpanding Hope's bright sail.\n\r\n\nThey fall not who ne'er rise,\n\r\nBut they who try the skies.\n\r\nFew mount on pinion wings:\n\r\nStraight course to humbler things.\n\r\nFell Lucifer through pride\n\r\nAngels in heaven reside.\n\r\nOne, traitor, sunk in night:\n\r\nThe eleven are stars of light.\n\r\n\nBe pure, be wholly pure,\n\r\nOf this make ever sure,\n\r\nLest thou, by heeding not,\n\r\nChrist's spotless robe shouldst spot.\n\r\nLet modest be thine eye:\n\r\nThy tongue speak maidenly:\n\r\nThy mind not pandering,\n\r\nThy foot not wandering:\n\r\nNor loud laugh marking thee,\n\r\nAs one we blush to see.\n\r\n\nThy poor and tarnished wear,\n\r\nThy unadorn&#232;d hair,\n\r\nI bonour more than pearls,\n\r\nOr silken dress, or curls.\n\r\n\nFair flower is modest face,\n\r\nAnd paleness is true grace:\n\r\nAnd virtues plentiful\n\r\nAre braid most beautiful.\n\r\nWith paints let others dress\n\r\nThe living God's likeness;\n\r\nLive tablet they of sin,\n\r\nAnd all that's base within.\n\r\nWhate'er thou hast of beauty,\n\r\nDie let it all to duty: \n\r\nBut beauty of the soul--\n\r\n'Tis God's--it keep thou whole.\n\r\n\nOf men, though good they be,\n\r\nThe sight 'twere best thou flee.\n\r\nSome cheat might thee entrance,\n\r\nOr be entranced perchance:\n\r\nEye now with eye bespangling,\n\r\nAnd word with word entangling,\n\r\nThen cheek with cheek o'erglowing,\n\r\nAnd mutual passion flowing.\n\r\n'Tis well: but not for thee:\n\r\nNot thine the accursed tree:\n\r\nThe tree of Life thy care;\n\r\nThe serpent's guile beware!\n\r\n\nO maiden, hear my word,\n\r\nHave thou no other lord;\n\r\nThy Bridegroom reigns above\n\r\nAnd bids thee faithful prove.\n\r\n133\n\r\nThou from the flesh hast fled,\n\r\nAnd it to thee is dead,\n\r\nWhy turn to it again,\n\r\nAnd make thy work all vain?\n\r\nThat singleness of thine\n\r\nIs a rare gift divine:\n\r\nFew they whom it adorns,\n\r\nAs rose among the thorns.\n\r\nSuch grace'tis thine to know:\n\r\nHigh o'er the snares below,\n\r\nBy which the wicked fall,\n\r\nThou safely passest all.\n\r\n\nLo! one no sooner builds,\n\r\nAnd bridal chamber gilds,\n\r\nThan she with mournful gloom\n\r\nForth bears him to the tomb.\n\r\nFelt one a father's pride?\n\r\nAt once the loved child died.\n\r\nAnd oh! the mother's pain\n\r\nOf travailing in vain!\n\r\n\nAnd jealousy, ah me!\n\r\nHow frightful 'tis to see,\n\r\n134\n\r\nWhen each the other taunts,\n\r\nWhere stolen friendship haunts!\n\r\n\nWhat wormwood and what gall,\n\r\nWorst recompence of all,\n\r\nTo rear up family,\n\r\nAnd then dishonoured be!\n\r\n\nOne care is thine, one call,\n\r\nTo look to God in all!\n\r\nBut little thou dost need:\n\r\nThat little God will speed.\n\r\n\nShelter and barley cake\n\r\nSufficient wealth will make:\n\r\nNor shall dire need impart\n\r\nKeen edge to tempter's dart,\n\r\nAs when Christ, hard bestead,\n\r\nHe bade turn stones to bread.\n\r\n\nBy thee, however tried,\n\r\nBe all base gain denied:\n\r\nFowls of the air God feeds,\n\r\nSure then His saints He heeds.\n\r\n\n135\n\r\nOf oil, if faith prevail,\n\r\nThy cruse shall never fail.\n\r\nBy Cherith's desert brook\n\r\nAt the great Prophet look!\n\r\nTo feed him ravens sped:\n\r\nSo too shalt thou be fed!\n\r\n\nHow Thecla from the flame,\n\r\nAnd lions, unscathed came,\n\r\nThou know'st: and how great Paul,\n\r\nPreacher of truth to all,\n\r\nBore hunger, thirst, and cold,\n\r\nThrough death's worst forms still bold;\n\r\nThat thou might'st look, O maid,\n\r\nTo God alone for aid,\n\r\nWho in the wilderness\n\r\nWith food can myriads bless.\n\r\n\nLo! beauty fadeth fast,\n\r\nNor will earth's glories last:\n\r\nWealth is a failing stream,\n\r\nAnd power an empty dream.\n\r\n\nBut thou, faith's sail unfurled,\n\r\nHast fled this erring world,\n\r\nSteering thy course on high\n\r\nTo realms beyond the sky.\n\r\nThere in the holy shrine\n\r\nThou shalt for ever shine:\n\r\nAnd there with angels raise\n\r\nThe song of endless praise!\n\r\n\nA better portion far\n\r\nThan sons and daughters are!\n\r\n\nBut maidens, be ye wise,\n\r\nAnd watch with longing eyes,\n\r\nThat when Christ shall return\n\r\nYour lamps may brightly burn:\n\r\nThat with the Bridegroom ye\n\r\nMay enter in, and see\n\r\nThe beauty and the grace\n\r\nOf His own dwelling place,\n\r\nAnd share in truth and love\n\r\nThe mysteries above.\n\r\n\n","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1876","classifications":null}]
