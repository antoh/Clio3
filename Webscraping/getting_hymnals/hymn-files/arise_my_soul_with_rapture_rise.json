That Power Divine\n\r\nIs throned in light's unbounded blaze;\n\r\nAnd countless worlds and angels join\n\r\nTo swell the glorious song of praise.\n\r\n\n4 And will He deign to lend an ear,\n\r\nWhen I, poor sinful mortal, pray?\n\r\nYes, boundless goodness! He will hear,\n\r\nNor cast the meanest wretch away.\n\r\n\n5 Then let me serve Thee all my days,\n\r\nAnd may my zeal with years increase;\n\r\nFor pleasant, Lord, are all Thy ways,\n\r\nAnd all Thy paths are paths of peace.\n\r\n","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1871","classifications":"Gender Neutral"}]
