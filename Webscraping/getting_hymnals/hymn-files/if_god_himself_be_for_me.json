Christ, the head and master,\n\r\nBefriend me from above,\n\r\nWhat foe or what disaster\n\r\nCan drive me from His love?\n\r\n\n2 I build on this foundation,\n\r\nThat Jesus and his blood\n\r\nAlone are my salvation,\n\r\nMy true, eternal good.\n\r\nWithout Him all that pleases\n\r\nIs valueless on earth;\n\r\nThe gifts I have from Jesus \n\r\nAlone have priceless worth.\n\r\n\n3 Christ Jesus is my splendor,\n\r\nMy sun, my light, alone;\n\r\nWere He not my defender\n\r\nBefore God's judgment throne,\n\r\nI never should find favor\n\r\nAnd mercy in His sight\n\r\nBut be destroyed forever\n\r\nAs darkness by the light. \n\r\n\n4 He canceled my offenses,\n\r\nDelivered me from death;\n\r\nHe is the Lord who cleanses\n\r\nMy soul from sin through faith.\n\r\nIn Him I can be cheerful,\n\r\nCourageous on my way;\n\r\nIn Him I am not fearful\n\r\nOf God's great Judgment Day.\n\r\n\n5 For no one can condemn me\n\r\nOr set my hope aside;\n\r\nNow hell no more can claim me;\n\r\nIts fury I deride.\n\r\nNo sentence now reproves me,\n\r\nNo guilt destroys my peace;\n\r\nFor Christ, my Savior, loves me\n\r\nAnd shields me with His grace.\n\r\n\n6 Who clings with resolution\n\r\nTo Him whom Satan hates\n\r\nMust look for persecution;\n\r\nFor him the burden waits\n\r\nOf mock'ry, shame, and losses\n\r\nHeaped on his blameless head;\n\r\nA thousand plagues and crosses\n\r\nWill be his daily bread.\n\r\n\n7 From me this is not hidden,\n\r\nYet am I not afraid;\n\r\nI leave my cares, as bidden,\n\r\nTo whom my vows were paid.\n\r\nThough life from me be taken\n\r\nAnd ev'rything I own\n\r\nI trust in You unshaken\n\r\nAnd cleave to You alone.\n\r\n\n8 No danger, thirst, or hunger,\n\r\nNo pain or poverty,\n\r\nNo earthly tyrant's anger\n\r\nShall ever vanquish me.\n\r\nThough earth should break asunder,\n\r\nMy fortress You shall be;\n\r\nNo fire or sword or thunder\n\r\nShall sever You from me.\n\r\n\n 9 No angel and no gladness,\n\r\nNo throne, no pomp, no show,\n\r\nNo love, no hate, no sadness,\n\r\nNo pain, no depth of woe,\n\r\nNo scheming, no contrivance,\n\r\nNo subtle thing or great\n\r\nShall draw me from Your guidance\n\r\nNor from You separate.\n\r\n\n10 My heart with joy is springing;\n\r\nI am no longer sad.\n\r\nMy soul is filled with singing;\n\r\nYour sunshine makes me glad.\n\r\nThe sun that cheers my spirit\n\r\nIs Jesus Christ, my King;\n\r\nThe heav'n I shall inherit\n\r\nMakes me rejoice and sing.\n\r\n\n","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"2006","classifications":"Non-Archaic"},{"title":"Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary","hymnalID":"ELH","number":"517","text":"1 If God Himself be for me,\n\r\nI may

naught.\n\r\n\n2 This I believe, yea, rather,\n\r\nIn this I make my boast,\n\r\nThat God is my dear Father,\n\r\nThe Friend who loves me most;\n\r\nAnd that, whate'er betide me,\n\r\nMy Savior is at hand\n\r\nThrough stormy seas to guide me\n\r\nAnd bring me safe to land.\n\r\n\n3 I build on this foundation:\n\r\nThat Jesus and His blood\n\r\nAlone are my salvation,\n\r\nThe true, eternal good.\n\r\nWithout Him all that pleases\n\r\nIs valueless on earth;\n\r\nThe gifts I owe to Jesus\n\r\nAlone my love are worth.\n\r\n\n4 My Jesus is my Splendor,\n\r\nMy soul's bright beaming

am not fearful\n\r\nOf God's great Judgment Day.\n\r\n\n6 Naught, naught, can e'er condemn me,\n\r\nNor set my hope aside;\n\r\nNow hell no more can claim me,\n\r\nIts fury I deride.\n\r\nNo sentence e'er reproves me,\n\r\nNo ill destroys my peace,\n\r\nFor Christ, my Savior, loves me\n\r\nAnd shields me with His grace.\n\r\n\n7 His Holy Spirit dwelleth\n\r\nWithin my willing heart,\n\r\nTames it when it rebelleth\n\r\nAnd soothes the keenest smart.\n\r\nHe crowns His work with blessing,\n\r\nAnd helpeth me to cry,\n\r\n\"My Father!\" without ceasing,\n\r\nTo Him who dwells on high.\n\r\n\n8 And when my soul is lying\n\r\nWeak, trembling, and opprest,\n\r\nHe pleads with groans and sighing\n\r\nThat cannot be expressed;\n\r\nBut God's quick eye discerns them,\n\r\nAlthough they give no sound,\n\r\nAnd into language turns them\n\r\nE'en in the heart's deep ground.\n\r\n\n9 To mine His Spirit speaketh\n\r\nSweet word of holy cheer,\n\r\nHow God, to him that seeketh\n\r\nFor rest, is always near,\n\r\nAnd how He hath erected\n\r\nA city fair and new,\n\r\nWhere what our faith expected\n\r\nWe evermore shall view.\n\r\n\n10 In yonder home doth flourish\n\r\nMy heritage, my lot;\n\r\nThough here I die and perish,\n\r\nMy heav'n shall fail me not.\n\r\nThough care my life oft saddens\n\r\nAnd causeth tears to flow,\n\r\nThe light of Jesus gladdens\n\r\nAnd sweetens ev'ry woe.\n\r\n\n11 Who clings with resolution\n\r\nTo Him whom Satan hates\n\r\nMust look for persecution\n\r\nWhich never here abates;\n\r\nReproaches, griefs and losses\n\r\nRain fast upon his head,\n\r\nA thousand plagues and crosses\n\r\nBecome his daily bread.\n\r\n\n12 All this I am prepared for,\n\r\nYet am I not afraid;\n\r\nBy Thee shall all be cared for,\n\r\nTo whom my vows were paid.\n\r\nThough life and limb it cost me,\n\r\nAnd all the earthly store\n\r\nWhich once so much engrossed me,\n\r\nI love Thee all the more.\n\r\n\n13 Not fire, nor sword, not thunder,\n\r\nShall sever me from Thee;\n\r\nThough earth be rent asunder,\n\r\nThou'rt mine eternally.\n\r\nNot hunger, thirst, nor danger,\n\r\nNot pain, or pinching want,\n\r\nNor mighty princes' anger\n\r\nMy fearless soul shall daunt.\n\r\n\n14 No angel, and no gladness,\n\r\nNo throne, no pomp, nor show,\n\r\nNo love, no hate, no sadness,\n\r\nNo pain, no depth of woe,\n\r\nNo scheme of man's contrivance,\n\r\nThough it be great or small,\n\r\nShall draw me from Thy guidance\n\r\nNor one of these, nor all!\n\r\n\n15 My merry heart is springing,\n\r\nAnd knows not how to pine;\n\r\n'Tis full of joy and singing,\n\r\nAnd radiancy divine, \n\r\nThe Sun whose smiles so cheers me\n\r\nIs Jesus Christ alone;\n\r\nTo have Him always near me\n\r\nIs heav'n itself begun.\n\r\n\n","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1996","classifications":null}]
