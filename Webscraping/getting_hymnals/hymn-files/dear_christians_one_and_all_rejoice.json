holy rapture singing,\n\r\nProclaim the wonders God has done,\n\r\nHow His right arm the vict'ry won;\n\r\nWhat price our ransom cost Him!\n\r\n\n2 Fast bound in Satan's chains I lay;\n\r\nDeath brooded darkly o'er me.\n\r\nSin was my torment night and day;\n\r\nIn sin my mother bore me.\n\r\nBut daily deeper still I fell;\n\r\nMy life became a living hell,\n\r\nSo firmly sin possessed me.\n\r\n\n3 My own good works all came to naught,\n\r\nNo grace or merit gaining;\n\r\nFree will against God's jugment fought,\n\r\nDead to all good remaining.\n\r\nMy fears increased till sheer despair\n\r\nLeft only death to be my share;\n\r\nThe pangs of hell I suffered.\n\r\n\n4 But God had seen my wretched state\n\r\nBefore the world's foundation,\n\r\nAnd mindful of His mercies great,\n\r\nHe planned for my salvation.\n\r\nHe turned to me a father's heart;\n\r\nHe did not choose the easy part\n\r\nBut gave His dearest treasure.\n\r\n\n5 God said to His beloved Son:\n\r\n\"It's time to have compassion.\n\r\nThen go, bright jewel of My crown,\n\r\nAnd bring to all salvation.\n\r\nFrom sin and sorrow set them free;\n\r\nSlay bitter death for them that they\n\r\nMay live with You forever.\"\n\r\n\n6 The Son obeyed His Father's will,\n\r\nWas born of virgin mother;\n\r\nAnd God's good pleasure to fulfill,\n\r\nHe came to be my brother.\n\r\nHis royal pow'r disguised He bore;\n\r\nA servant's form, like mine, He wore\n\r\nTo lead the devil captive.\n\r\n\n7 To me He said: \"Stay close to Me,\n\r\nI am your rock and castle.\n\r\nYour ransom I Myself will be;\n\r\nFor you I strive and wrestle.\n\r\nFor I am yours, and you are Mine,\n\r\nAnd where I am you may remain;\n\r\nThe foe shall not divide us.\n\r\n\n8 \"Though he will shed My precious blood,\n\r\nMe of My life bereaving,\n\r\nAll this I suffer for your good;\n\r\nBe steadfast and believing.\n\r\nLife will from death the vict'ry win;\n\r\nMy innocence shall bear your sin,\n\r\nAnd you are blest forever.\n\r\n\n9 \"Now to My Father I depart,\n\r\nFrom earth to heav'n ascending,\n\r\nAnd, heav'nly wisdom to impart,\n\r\nThe Holy Spirit sending;\n\r\nIn trouble He will comfort you\n\r\nAnd teach you always to be true\n\r\nAnd into truth shall guide you.\n\r\n\n10 \"What I on earth have done and taught,\n\r\nGuide all your life and teaching;\n\r\nSo shall the kingdom's work be wrought\n\r\nAnd honored in your preaching.\n\r\nBut watch lest foes with base alloy\n\r\nThe heav'nly treausre should destroy;\n\r\nThis final word I leave you.\"\n\r\n\n","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"2006","classifications":"Non-Archaic"},{"title":"Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary","hymnalID":"ELH","number":"378","text":"1 Dear Christians, one and all,
