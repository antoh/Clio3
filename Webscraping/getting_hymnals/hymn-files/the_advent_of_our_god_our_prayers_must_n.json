The advent of our God\n\r\nWith eager hearts we greet,\n\r\nAnd singing, haste upon the road\n\r\nHis coming reign to meet.\n\r\n\n2. For, lo, God's Word and Son\n\r\nCame down to make us free,\n\r\nAnd he a servant's form put on,\n\r\nTo bring us liberty.\n\r\n\n3. Daughter of Zion, rise\n\r\nTo meet thy lowly king;\n\r\nLet not thy heart in hast despise\n\r\nThe peace He comes to bring.\n\r\n\n4. For judgment doth befall\n\r\nThe stubborn who refuse,\n\r\nBut God doth give His light to all\n\r\nWho cherish His good news.\n\r\n\n5. Then evil flee away\n\r\nBefore the rising dawn!\n\r\nLet this old Adam day by day\n\r\nGod's image still put on.\n\r\n\n6. Thou Liberator true,\n\r\nAll glory be to thee,\n\r\nTo whom in God our praise is due\n\r\nFor all eternity.","doNotDisplay":"0","date":"1966","classifications":null}]
