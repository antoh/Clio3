SHEG,again_we_hail_the_opening_mor,Songs and Hymns of the Earliest Greek Christian Poets,1876,,"Again we hail the opening morn,

Again breaks forth the day new-born,

Which, rising in victorious might,

Chases away black-wandering night!

Again, my mind, in early songs

Praise Him to whom all praise belongs;

Who gave to morning dawn the light

Who gave the glittering stars to night,

Which to their Maker and their King

Around the world in chorus sing.

For o'er prolific matter, high,

Moves ether pure in fiery sky;

Where glides the moon in glorious trim,

Cutting the last encircling rim:


For to the eighth revolving stream

The star-borne courses brightly gleam.

But now beyond the starry poles

A counter sea of glory rolls,

Unbosomed; and with dance divine

Doth the Eternal Mind enshrine,

Which covered hath with hoary wings

The palace of the King of kings.

What is beyond none may relate,

Nor mind of man can penetrate:

Eternal severance restrains,

And happy silence ever reigns.

From Root, or Spring, or Fountain one

A threefold lighted Form hath shone:

For where the Father dwells above,

There dwelleth too His own heart's love,

His glorious Son, wisdom perf&#232;ct,

And of all worlds the Architect:

And in the Unity combined

The Spirit's holy Light hath shined.

One Root of Good, one Fount of Love,

Whence sprung the bliss supreme above:

And the bright holy lamps divine

In equal glory ever shine.

And thence in this fair world of ours,

With high-born intellectual powers,

A chorus now of deathless kings

The Triune glory ever sings.

And near the Fount of Love and Truth

Angelic band in changeless youth,

Guided by holy Wisdom's mind,

Immortal wreath of beauty find.

But some with dark averted eyes

Fall mindless from the lofty skies

Downward the gloomy depths among,

And bring the higher world along;

Down, down to Matter's utmost bound,

Where, settling in the depth profound,

Nature assigns them birth and place,

A God-like, though God-fallen race.


Hence giant heroes took their birth,

The mighty conquerors of earth;

And hence Breath sown o'er all the ground

Each varying type of life hath found.

But all things to Thy counsel hold,

Things past, or present, new or old:

Whate'er we have, whate'er we share,

Of all from Thee the sources are.

The Father and the Mother Thou,

Male, female, unto Thee we bow:

Or voice be heard, or all be still,

'Tis just as ordered by Thy will.

'And Thou or Nature Thyself art,

Or Nature is Thy counterpart:

And Thou art King; and ages all

Within Thine age unmeasured fall.

May I my song aright renew,

O Thou! the Root whence all things grew!

Hail! Thou, the world's Original;

Hail! Thou, the Spring, First Cause of all.

All numbers blending into one,

The Uncreated, God alone!

All hail, all hail, Thou One Divine!

All joy, all happiness be Thine!

Bend Thou, O bend propitious ear,

And this my hymn of praises bear,

Speed on true Wisdom's opening day,

Pour blessings down in rich array:

Yea, grace-distilling streams pour down,

That I may win contentment's crown

In life's sweet calm; the happy mean

Give me, riches and want between.

Off from my limbs diseases ward,

My soul from stormy passions guard:

Let no dark thoughts my steps attend:

My life from biting cares defend;

Lest, mind, borne down by earthly ill,

To soar should find nor time nor will.

But grant me with free wing to rise,

And join the chorus of the skies,

And there with Thine for ever sing

Ere earth's foundations yet were laid.


Ineffable Thy counsels, Lord,

Father of all, by which was born

The Christ! a virgin's throes afford

The Light of Life to world forlorn!


A Man! and yet of ages gone,

And of all ages yet to come,

Throughout eternity, the One

Upholder, Perfecter, and Sum.


Thyself, O Christ, art Fount of Light,

Light of the Father's Light, bright Ray!

Dark matter thou didst burst; and night

To holy souls Thou turn'st to day.


Yea! Founder of the world Thou art,

And moulder of each starry sphere:

To earth her spurs Thou dost impart;

While men hail Thee their Saviour dear.


For Thee his chariot Titan drives,

The quenchless fount of morning light.

From Thee the bull-faced moon derives

Her power to loose the gloom of night.


By Thee the year with fruit is crowned:

By Thee the flocks and herds are fed:

Productive Thou dost make the ground;

And to the poor Thou givest bread.


For Thou from Thine o'erflowing store

Of grace ineffable and love,

O'er surface of all worlds dost pour

The fertile sunshine from above.


And from Thy bosom forth did spring

To life both light, and mind, and soul:

O pity then Thine own offspring

Imprisoned under hard control,


By mortal limbs, by flesh and blood,

Coerced, and measures stern of fate:

O save Thine own, Thou great and good,

Nor let sick mind sick body hate!


Persuasion to my words nod Thou,

And to my deeds such honest fame,

That truth I never disavow,

Nor Sparta nor Cyrene shame!


But may my soul, unbowed by grief,

Draw all her nourishment from Thee,

Stretching both eyes, in calm relief,

Up to Thy light, from sorrow free!


That, cleansed from dregs of worldly soil,

I may by straight course upward mount,

And 'scaping from earth's care and toil,

Be mingled with the soul's own fount!


Life such of pure content and praise,

Do Thou to Thy poor harper grant,

While still to Thee the hymn I raise,

And glory to the Father chant,


And Spirit, mid-enthroned compeer,

The Parent Root and Branch between!

Be such on earth my bright career,

Nor sin nor sorrow intervene;


Until, within the courts above,

The travail of my soul shall cease,

Still singing hymns of heavenly love

In glory and in perfect peace.


Thee, Thee, the Fount of love, we bless,

O Father, rock and strength of Thine;

And Thee alike, His form express,

And seal, all beauty, Son Divine;


And Holy Breath, of both the crown,

Whose quickening gifts like billows roll:

Thou with the Father, send Him down

To cheer and fertilize my soul!

3 Come, for creation groans,

Impatient of Thy stay,

Worn out with these long years of ill,

These ages of delay.


4 Come, and make all things new;

Build up this ruined earth;

Restore our faded Paradise,

Creation's second birth.


5 Come, and bring Thy reign

Of everlasting peace;

Come, take the kingdom to Thyself,

Great King of Righteousness.

Deep as of the sealed tomb.

Earth had lost the links which bound it

To the throne of light above;

Straight a ray pierced through the cloud,

Spirits mightily awakening

From their dark and heavy shroud.

Chasing mist and gloom away;

Happy they on whom it gathers

With its full and perfect day!

At evening&#8217;s calm and holy hour,

As if its inmost depths discerned

The presence of a loftier power?

Hast thou not heard &#8217;mid forest glades,

While ancient rivers murmured by,

A voice from forth the eternal shades,

That spake a present Deity?

And as, upon the sacred page,

Thine eye in rapt attention turned

O&#8217;er records of a holier age,

Hath not thy heart within thee burned?

It was the voice of God that spake

In silence to thy silent heart;

And bade each worthier thought awake,

And every dream of earth depart.

Voice of our God, O, yet be near!

In low, sweet accents, whisper peace;

Direct us on our pathway here,

Then bid in heaven our wanderings cease.

Many a miracle and sign,

In thy Father&#8217;s name divine,

Manifested forth thy might

In the chosen people&#8217;s sight.

But, O Saviour! not alone

Thus thy glory was made known;

With the mourner thou didst grieve,

Every human want relieve;

Far thy matchless power above

Stands the witness of thy love.

Thou, who by the open grave,

Ere thy voice was raised to save,

Didst with those fond sisters shed

Tears above the faithful dead;

Even thy word of might appears

Less resistless than thy tears.

Lord! it is not ours to gaze

On thy works of ancient days;

But thy love, unchanged and bright,

More than all those works of might,

More than miracle or sign,

Makes us ever, ever thine.

And all the earthly store

Which once so much engrossed me,

I love Thee all the more.

Shall sever me from Thee;

Though earth be rent asunder,

Thou'rt mine eternally.

Not hunger, thirst, nor danger,

Not pain, or pinching want,

Nor mighty princes' anger

My fearless soul shall daunt.


14 No angel, and no gladness,

No throne, no pomp, nor show,

No love, no hate, no sadness,

No pain, no depth of woe,

No scheme of man's contrivance,

Though it be great or small,

Shall draw me from Thy guidance

Nor one of these, nor all!


15 My merry heart is springing,

And knows not how to pine;

'Tis full of joy and singing,

And radiancy divine, 

The Sun whose smiles so cheers me

That radiant form of Thine;

The veil of sense hangs dark between

Thy blessed face and mine.


2 I see Thee not, I hear Thee not,

Yet art Thou oft with me;

And earth hath ne'er so dear a spot

As where I meet with Thee.


3 Like some bright dream that comes unsought,

When slumbers o'er me roll,

Thine image ever fills my thought,

And charms my ravished soul.


4 Yet though I have not seen, and still

Must rest in faith alone;

I love Thee, dearest Lord, and will,

Unseen, but not unknown.

And still this throbbing heart,

SHEG,lift_up_thyself_my_soul,Songs and Hymns of the Earliest Greek Christian Poets,1876,,"I. (1-11).

Lift up thyself, my soul,

Above this world's control!

Spend and be spent in holy hymns of praise:

Be armed with pure desire,

Burn with celestial fire:

Unto the King of gods our voice we raise:

To Him a crown we weave, and bring

A sacrifice of words, a bloodless offering.


II. (11-22).

20

Thee on the troubled deep,

Thee o'er the islands steep,

Thee through the mighty continents of land,

Thee in the city's throng,

Or mountain tops along,

Or when in celebrated plains I stand,

Thee, Thee, O blessed One, I sing,

Thee, Thee, O Father of the world, Eternal King!


III. (23-36).

Thy praise I hymn by night,

Thy praise at morning light,

Thy praise by day, Thy praise at eventide.

This know the hoary stars,

And moon with silver bars,

And chiefly he that doth on high preside

O'er all the host of heaven, the sun,

Who measuring time for holy souls his course doth run.


IV. (37-50).

21

Fain to thy folds I sped,

And to Thy bosom fled,

Winging my steps from Matter's wide-spread rule:

Now on famed mountain peak,

Thy face alone to seek;

Now on the plain I hailed thy vestibule.

A suppliant thus to many a shrine

Of sacred rites I came, and mysteries divine.


V. (51-67).

And now to southern land,

And Libya's desert strand

I roamed, where neither godless spirit reigns,

Nor teeming cities' strife

Calls men to busy life;

That so my soul, from woeful toils and pains

And passions' war and groans set free,

And all the ills of fate, might harmonize with Thee.


VI. (68-75).

22

And might, in blest relief,

Unshackled now from grief,

With lips and tongue all cleansed, and hallowed mind,

Repay the hymn to Thee,

The hymn full due from me.

Be Earth and Ether holily combined

And Air and Sea with one accord

Be still, and join in adoration to the Lord!


VII. (76-85).

Swift breath of winds, be still,

And whirling pool and rill,

And floods that are at rivers' mouths forth hurled;

And streams from fountain-heads

That rush down rocky beds:

And hushed be ye, deep hollows of the world;

While breath in holy hymns is spent,

And sacrifice of praise in upward strains is sent.


VIII. (86-94).

23

Down sink the serpent's trail!

Nor let their craft prevail!

Down sink the wing&#232;d dragon underground;

Who loves to cloud the soul,

The god who doth control

This lower world, and idol-worship found,

And urgeth on the dogs of hell

Against God's praying people, His true Israel!


IX. (95-107).

O bless&#232;d Father, Friend,

My soul do Thou defend.

From soul-devouring dogs; defend my prayer,

Defend my deeds, my life,

From their destructive strife

And charge Thy holy angels, that they bear

To Thee this offering of my mind:

For hymns they carry that with Thee acceptance find.


X. (108-117).

24

Now am I borne along

To lists of sacred song:

Now holy words in streams spontaneous flow:

A voice within me rings,

And toucheth my heart-strings:

But unto me, O Father, mercy show;

Forgive, O Bless&#232;d, if I stray,

In theme divine, and miss the rightful ordered way.


XI. (118-125).

What eye can steadfast gaze,

When Thy dread beacons blaze?

What eye so wise, so strong, of mortal man,

That it unclosed may bear

Thy vivid lightning's glare?

E'en of the mighty ones on high none can,

However strong, however bold,

The glorious brightness of Thy Majesty behold.


XII. (126-137).

25

Now aims the mind too far,

And finds repelling bar,

Nor can it penetrate by utmost strain

The depths so dazzling bright,

Where Thou dost dwell in light:

So, falling back from efforts feebly vain,

It courts within its proper scope

An object known whereon to fix the eye of hope;


XIII. (138-146).

That for Thy hymns it might

Thence pluck fair flowers of light,

Nor leave to thankless winds an offering:

But render back to Thee

Thine own, for Thine they be;

For what of all things is not Thine, O King?

O Father of all fathers, Thou!

To Thine eternal Fatherhood all beings bow!


XIV. (147-157).

26

But Father Thou hadst none;

Thou art the self-sprung One,

Before all worlds the sole great Mind existing:

Germ of whate'er we see,

Spur of all things that be

Root of first worlds, by Thee alone subsisting:

Light of all light, Truth's basis sure;

And Wisdom's everflowing stream, and fountain pure.


XV. (158-165).

O Mind immutable!

O Light inscrutable!

Thine is the eye that guides the lightning fire:

In Thee the ages live,

Thou dost their limits give;

Who can Thy praises reach, Eternal Sire?

Thou art beyond the dreams of men;

Beyond the reach of mind, or highest angel's ken.


XVI. (166-173).

27

O'er all Thy rule is spread,

The living and the dead;

To minds that be, the parent Mind Thou art;

All heaven Thou dost control,

Thou nourishest the soul,

And dost to spirit energy impart;

The Spring Thou art whence all things flow,

And from eternity the Root whence all things grow.


XVII. (174-183).

The only One, yet all;

In Thee all numbers fall;

The only One, yet countless evermore:

The self-existent Mind,

Yet mind with law combined;

Mind's realm, yet all the realm of mind before:

Through all, yet all beyond, art Thou:

To Thee, the Seed of all existing things, we bow.


XVIII. (184-190).

28

Thou art the Eternal Root,

Thou art the spreading Shoot!

Or male or female Thou be called, 'tis one;

To mind Thou nature art,

And dost Thyself impart,

But mind enlightened ne'er can say, 'tis done;

But here and there a word outpours,

While feebly it the unfathomed depth around explores.


XIX. (191-198).

Thou art the Parent Tree,

All have their life from Thee,

Or stem or branch, whatever is, is Thine.

Thou art the Light of light,

The Light of day so bright,

The Light that shineth evermore Divine:

Thou art, again, the hidden Light,

By its own glory hidden far from mortal sight.


XX. (199-209).

29

Yet one, yet all, one Lord,

One only, yet forth poured,

Through all forth poured in holy Mystery:

Of Thee thus sprung the Son,

Wisdom, the glorious One,

Creator of the universe to be.

The Godhead severed into twain

By birth ineffable, unsevered doth remain.


XXI. (210-216).

Yet One, though Twain, though Three:

Mysterious Trinity!

For Thou art One in Three, and Three in One.

I sing Thee, Unity!

I sing Thee, Trinity!

The Triune King, the Father, Spirit, Son!

The Light divided is not spent,

The One pervading mind, though parted, is not rent.


XXII. (217-224).

30

Thy holy Will is done,

'Tis through the Eternal Son;

And from the outpoured Godhead forth there springs,

Which cannot be exprest

In words, the Spirit Blest,

The Uncreated! we of wondrous things

Have spoken; but we speak not there:

We dare not if we could, we could not if we dare.


XXIII. (225-231).

Who knows the Eternal Laws?

Who knows the First Great Cause?

We may not say a Second, or a Third.

O Birth beyond our reach;

O Spring defying speech!

What mortal to the task himself could gird?

O matchless Holy One, between

The Father and the Son Thy Light doth intervene.


XXIV. (232-240).

31

All reverence to Thee,

Eternal Spirit, be!

Thou of the Three the middle rank dost hold.

And now, most glorious Son,

Thy praises be begun!

Thy birth, thy generation, is untold:

The Father's Son, the Father's Will,

With Him Thou present wast, and present Thou art still.


XXV. (241-253)

Thou with the Father art,

And ever next His heart;

Nor can deep flowing Time Thy birth reveal;

Nor aged Aeon say

When was Thy natal day;

He never learned, nor could remove the seal.

Son with the Father! He the same

Who should hereafter give to Aeon birth and name.


XXVI. (254-265).

32

Who hath adjudged the eye

Into God's depths to pry?

The subtle tongue will dare, but man is blind.

Such daring is in vain,

'Tis godless, and profane.

Thou dost to Thine pour light upon the mind,

And guard their hearts with holy care,

That they in darkness sink not through gross matter's snare.


XXVII. (266-275).

To Thee all holy praise

It well befits to raise;

For Thou of all art Father, all are Thine:

Thou all the worlds didst found,

Thou dost all ages bound,

Thou framedst all the host of heaven divine;

To Thee all minds of light do sing,

And starry spheres intelligent hail thee their King!


XXVIII. (276-285).

33

While round in holy choir

Dance their bright orbs of fire,

The blest ones all do shout and sing before Thee;

The world within, around,

They all Thy praise resound,

All in their stations evermore adore Thee:

Those in the zones; and those outside,

Who yet their several posts assigned in wisdom guide.


XXIX. (286-300).

These come to guard, or tame,

Earth's helmsmen, sons of fame;

Of link angelic, and who draw their birth

From old heroic race;

Who ever take their place,

By hidden ways, o'er men and things of earth:

And though of an unyielding will,

To dark-rayed worldly glories ever yield they still.


XXX. (301-311).

34

To Thee blithe nature sings,

And all from her that springs:

For Thou with heavenly breath dost them renew,

Forth pouring from above

Thy stores of grace and love,

Which ever fresh descend in showers and dew;

Thou to all nature nature art,

O Lord of worlds unstained! and dost Thine own impart.


XXXI. (312-319).

For nature Thou didst train

And school, that she again

Might parent be of every mortal thing;

The faithful counterpart

Of all that Thyself art,

Of life and health the everflowing spring!

That to the world's extremest bound

Each part in turn with living beauty might be crowned.


XXXII. (320-328).

35

For it were never right

That things should jar and fight,

Or dregs of earth with excellence contend;

But all by Thy decree

Is wrought in harmony;

Nor aught shall perish, nor the chorus end;

But each from other takes its share,

And all through one another taste Thy loving care.


XXXIII. (329-334).

The eternal wheel revolves,

And the dark riddle solves;

Things die; Thou sendest forth Thy breath, they live,

And in fresh glory bloom,

Renewed from mortal doom.

Thus nurtured nature nurturing doth give;

And she doth sing a deathless song

To Thee by all her children through the ages long.


XXXIV. (335-342).

36

In colour or in skin,

Without, or life within,

And deeds, however varied they may be,

Yet nature moulds them all

Obedient to her call;

And links them fast in holy unity;

And from all creatures thus doth raise

Of differing voices one harmonious hymn of praise.


XXXV. (343-357).

To Thee, their Lord and King,

All things their tribute bring

Of ceaseless praise; the night, the morn, the sky,

The lightning flash, the snow,

And things that spring and grow;

All bodies and all spirits; birds that fly,

And beasts that graze; seeds, plants, and roots;

The sea with all that swims, and earth with all her fruits.


XXXVI. (358-367).

37

The waves of trouble roll;

Look Thou upon my soul,

To act so powerless, to learn so slow,

Where on Thy Libyan sands

The mystic temple stands;

For hither I, Thy holy will to know,

Oppressed with grief, my steps have bent,

On prayer and supplication unto Thee intent.


XXXVII. (368-374).

Before Thy favouring eye

Earth's gloomy vapours fly:

Look Thou on me, and bid my sorrows cease.

'Tis so! e'en now my heart

Through food Thy hymns impart--

For Thine they are--hath nourishment of peace,

And points my mind with keen desire

To rise afresh to thoughts and words of heavenly fire.


XXXVIII. (375-380).

38

But send, O King, Thy light,

To quicken my dull sight,

And guide me on the road that leads to Thee.

And, Father, grant, I pray,

That from the body's sway

My better part, escaping, may be free,

And not again be downward hurled

Beneath the floods and eddies of this troubled world.


XXXIX. (381-391).

Yet here, while in the strife

Of world-enchain&#232;d life,

O Bless&#232;d, may kind fortune smile on me;

Nor stormy tempest blow

To check the holy glow,

Or rudely break the mind's tranquillity;

Lest inrush of the worldly flood

Should leave to me no leisure for the things of God.


XL. (392-400).

39

And whereto I have striven,

By grace which Thou hast given,

(For all good gifts of help and strength are Thine),

May I the ground retain,

Nor e'er fall back again.

For which Thy gifts this humble wreath of mine

From holy fields to Thee I bring,

O Thou of all creations pure the Eternal King;


XLI. (402-409).

To Thee and to Thy Son,

Thine own, the only One,

Alone of Thee begotten, the All-wise,

Whom from eternity

Thou hadst, and hast, with Thee,

Though forth from Thee He came to harmonize

All things, and fashion, form, and guide,

By wisdom's breath outpoured, and over all preside.


XLII. (410-416).

40

The hoary ages wake,

And their due course take,

At his command; and of His matchless skill,

And workmanship divine,

As if by plumb and line,

This rugged world He mouldeth to His will,

Whate'er exists above the ground,

Or on its surface, or within its depths profound.


XLIII. (417-427).

And merciful and kind

He shines with holy mind

On toiling mortals; and doth bring relief;

For He doth loose the chain

Of toilsome care and pain;

Effects their good, and drives away their grief.

The God who did the world create,

What marvel that His own He guard from whelming fate?


XLIV. (428-440).

41

And hither southward now,

That I might pay this vow

To Thee the mighty world's eternal guide,

I came from northern Thrace,

Where three years' dreary space

Near the Imperial Court I did abide,

In toil, with tears and anguish sore,

For on my shoulders I my mother country bore,


XLV. (441-454).

And well Thou know'st, good Lord,

How from my limbs was poured

A sweat of agony from day to day:

Nor rest had I by night

In that dire mental fight:

But watered was the couch on which I lay

From streaming eyes. Then to and fro,

To every shrine a suppliant I made haste to go.


XLVI. (455-462).

42

To all in turn I bring

Prayer, chaplet, offering,

And water with my tears each sacred floor,

That I might not with pain

Have journey made in vain,

But that Thou wouldst wide-open hopeful door.

Thus in my own and country's need

I with Thy holy ones through fruitful Thrace did plead;


XLVII. (463-473).

And who across the main,

Guard Carthaginian plain,

I sought them all, if they might succour me,

Throughout the region round,

Whom Thou with rays hadst crowned

Angelic, Thine attendant saints to be.

The blest ones helped my eager prayers,

They helped my many toils, and soothed my many cares.


XLVIII. (474-489).

43

Life did no pleasure yield,

While my poor country reeled

Half stunned: but Thou hast righted her, O King!

The Rock of Ages Thou,

To whom the world doth bow!

Crushed were my limbs, my soul a lifeless thing:

But Thou from Heaven hast breathed at length

New vigour on my soul, and on my limbs new strength.


XLIX. (490-497).

For Thou hast-brought relief,

And stayed o'erflowing grief:

Toils have an end, the wearied soul hath rest.

'Twas by Thy wisdom planned,

'Twas wrought out by Thy hand.

Thou to my mind hast given refreshment blest.

Now, O my God, do Thou ordain,

That to the Libyans these Thine own sweet gifts remain;


L. (498-505).

44

Of our long tribulation,

Of Thy so great Salvation,

A lasting record! Hear Thy suppliant's prayer;

And henceforth may my life

Be safe from harmful strife.

Loose me from toil, disease, and deadly care.

Thus to Thy servant bow Thine ear,

And grant my mental life be ever bright and clear.


LI. (506-523).

I would not showers of wealth

To try the soul's best health,

And leave no leisure for the things divine;

Nor poverty would I,

With downcast sullen eye,

Black spectre to the house, prone to repine,

Bowed down to earth with earthly cares.

Both grovel on the ground, and both are dangerous snares.


LII. (524-532).

45

And both forgetful are

Of better things by far,

The mind, and all that to the mind doth cling,

Unless, O heavenly Friend,

Thou shouldst Thy help extend.

Yea, Father, wisdom's holy self and spring,

Upon this faltering soul of mine

The light of mind from Thine own bosom cause to shine.


LIII. (533-543).

And on my heart, I pray,

Turn Thou blest wisdom's ray,

With helping hand, and point the holy road

That leadeth unto Thee;

And set Thy seal on me,

And let me have the token of my God;

And from my life, and from my prayer,

Drive earthly demons of presumption and despair.


LIV. (544-553).

46

And may my body be

From all dishonour free,

As fortress unassailable to foe;

And may my spirit pure

Unto the end endure

By Thine all-saving help. Full well I know,

That I do bear dark worldly stain,

And held in bondage am by earthly passions' chain;


LV. (544-563).

But Thou deliverer art,

And cleanser of the heart.

From evils circling round escape afford,

And from diseases all,

And bonds that fret and gall.

I bear Thy seed, of noble mind, good Lord,

A spark that issued forth from Thee,

And flashing down through depths of matter lit on me.


LVI. (564-574).

47

For in the world, O King,

Thou mad'st a soul to spring,

And in the body, through the soul, a mind:

O pity then Thine own,

The handmaid from Thy throne:

From Thee descending, hapless I did bind

Myself as labourer free to earth:

Not labourer now, but slave, downfallen from my birth.


LVII. (575-585).

For, me the world around

With witchery hath bound,

Some little strength may yet remain in me

Of secret inner light,

Not yet extinguished quite:

But o'er my head is rolled a mighty sea,

That doth make blind the mental eye

That would its God and things of heavenly worth descry.


LVIII. (586-592).

48

O look with pitying eye,

And hear the mournful cry

Of Thine own child, O Father good and kind:

Whom oft when she would rise

Up to her native skies,

Impelled by holy efforts of the mind,

Yet fascination of this world

Hath choked, and back to earth's dark mazes hurled.


LIX. (593-602).

But O! send forth Thy light,

A beacon fire through night,

To guide' and cheer me on my upward way;

And may that seed take root,

And, striking out its shoot

From small beginning, bead of flower display.

O Father, such Thy help divine,

Enthrone me in the light of life above to shine;


LX. (603-611).

49

Where nature cannot clasp

With her resistless grasp:

And whence no longer earth, or web of fate,

Can back recall to woe

And vain desires below.

Let brood deceitful that I scorn and hate

Of worldly passions scattered be,

And leave thy servant, O my God, at peace with Thee!


LXI. (612-627).

Me and earth's din betwixt

Be fiery barrier fixed.

Thy grace, O Father, to my soul reveal;

And let thy suppliant find,

With outspread wings of mind,

The ascending path, and bear aloft Thy seal,

A terror to the up-springing foe,

Who breathe to mortals godless thoughts from depths below;


LXII. (628-635).

50

But badge and token known

To those about Thy throne,

The holy ones, who all the heights survey

Of Thy bright world, and stand

As guards in high command,

Bearing the keys of upward fiery way,

That they may give an entrance free,

And open wide the gates of heavenly light to me.


LXIII. (636-645),

But still while creeping here

Upon this empty sphere

Of earth, yet not of earth grant me to be;

But from a better root

E'en here attesting fruit

To bear of fire-proved deeds, my God, to Thee;

And Thy true voice to hear and know,

And whate'er warms and makes in souls blest hope to grow.


LXIV. (646-653).

51

It doth me now repent

Of life on earth ill-spent:

Begone, the blear-eyed haze of godless men,

And built-up cities' strength

Begone, ye breadth and length

Of worldly aims, nor harass me again,

Ye sweet calamities, ye toys

Of mighty seeming, bootless boons, and joyless joys.


LXV. (654-661).

Tranced by your bravery

The soul in slavery

To earth is held; and wretched is indeed;

For of her own good things

This cup oblivion brings:

And things, wherewith to satisfy her need

She hoped, are forthwith snatched away;

And from vain dream she wakes to envy's shaft a prey.


LXVI. (662-670).

52

For fortune here below

A double face doth show,

False queen: whom if you haply win and trust,

And in her livery shine,

And at her table dine,

Soon rue your lot with bitter tears you must,

When down from pedestal so high

You fall in widespread ruin, and neglected lie.


LXVII. (672-683).

For here, from adverse sides,

Now good, now ill, betides:

To mortals such is life's necessity.

To God, or what hath birth

From God, but not to earth,

Is good unmingled with adversity.

Did cup of sweets intoxicate?

Ensnared I learnt by crop of woes a lesson late.


LXVIII. (684-693).

53

I hate these laws of change

And hence now upward range,

With wings expanded, to the peaceful sky:

To bright ethereal plains,

Where my dear Father reigns,

From earth, and earths two-sided gifts I fly.

O Steward of the life of mind,

To Thee I look; with Thee may I acceptance find.


LXIX. (694-703).

My soul doth hang on Thee:

Heed Thou Thy suppliant's plea,

Bound here on earth, yet struggling to ascend

The upward paths of mind:

As Thou thus far hast shined,

O shine yet more: light wings of succour lend

Snap double passions' bond, and chain

Of earth unloose, and let my soul her freedom gain.


LXX. (704-713).

54

For nature by these chains

Her treacherous power obtains,

And binds me down to earth a helpless prey;

But from the body freed,

And all its direful need,

Grant me to take swift flight to realms of day,

To Thine own halls and Thine own breast,

Whence flows the Fountain of the soul; and be at rest.


LXXI. (714-725).

A drop from Fountain Head

Poured, forth, to earth I sped,

An exile and a wanderer from Thee;

Me now, I pray, restore

To where I was before:

With light ancestral may I mingled be!

Tune Thou my mind with Thine own choir

In holiness to sing the hymns Thou dost inspire.


LXXII. (726-734).

55

Once saved from mortal plight,

Once mingled with the light,

O Father, grant I never enter more

Within earth's black domains

Of penalties and pains;

But while I yet am chained to this dark shore,

And bear life's drudgery below,

Bid Thou that fortune's breezes on me gently blow.

The chief of all the sons of men,

Shall we not welcome him?

Fill all his courts with sacred songs,

And from the temple wall

Wave garlands o&#8217;er the joyful throngs

That crowd his festival!

And still more freshly in the mind

Store up the hopes sublime

Which then were born for all mankind,

So blessed was the time;

And, underneath these hallowed eaves,

A Saviour will be born

In every heart that him receives,

SHEG,o_bride_of_christ_on_high,Songs and Hymns of the Earliest Greek Christian Poets,1876,,"O bride of Christ on high,

Thy Bridegroom glorify!

Always thyself keep pure,

In word and wisdom sure,

That bright with Him all-bright

Thou e'er mayst dwell in light.

Far better spouse is He

Than earthly spouse could be:

Thy union happier far

Than mortal unions are.


In bodily estate

Thou yet didst imitate

The intellectual powers,

Giving to Him thy hours:

And didst acquire on earth

The angels' right of birth.

'Tis ""bind and loose"" below,

Bodies from bodies grow:

Above each stands alone,

Nor loosing there is known.


Of pure existence, they

First bear the ethereal ray,

Spirit and fire: none rests,

Doing great God's behests.

But now wild matter found--

All nature flowing round

With unresisted force--

A mingled intercourse;

But God the flood restrained,

And marriage laws ordained.


But thou hast hence escaped,

And upward thy course shaped;

From matter's base alloy

To spirit's holy joy.

Mind harmonized with mind,

Doth truest pleasure find:

Such harmony is thine,

A harmony divine.

With flesh thou war dost wage,

And helpest God's image:


For thou art God's own breath,

With body yoked till death:

That out of wrestling sore,

At length the battle o'er,

And earth well beaten down,

Thou mayst receive the crown.

To marriage also raise,

But only second praise.

That is for passion given,

This is bright light of heaven:


That founds a pure offspring,

This is self-offering.

This honoured was, we hold,

At seasons marked of old.

To this in Paradise

Lo! Adam testifies:

For this on Sinai's peak

Doth Moses also speak;

128

And Zachary the priest,

Of God's true saints not least,


And whom we hail the rather

As the Forerunner's father.

But marriage hath its need:

Hence springs a holy seed:

And hence the virgin bride,

Honoured at God's own side.

Yet of the flesh it is, and earth,

All earthly from its birth.

When law and shadows ruled,

And we were sometime schooled,


Marriage held sceptre mild,

Yet like a little child.

But when the letter died,

The Spirit was supplied:

For Christ had come and borne

In flesh our woes and scorn:

Had brought Redemption nigh,

And then ascended high:

Christ, sprung from Virgin's womb,

Christ, Conqueror o'er the tomb.

Then continence did rise,

And this base world despise,

Which should its course have mended,

And high with Christ ascended.


Thou journey'st well! but haste!

Behind is fiery waste:

Take to thy steps good heed,

And to the mountain speed.

Cast not one backward glance

On Sodom, lest perchance


Thou, fixed upon the ground,

A pile of salt be found.

In battling with the flesh

Take ever courage fresh,

Neither by terror bent,

Nor over-confident.

Faint not, for He is nigh

Who will all strength supply.


A spark may kindle hell:

Water the flame cloth quell.

Full means to thee are lent

For good self-government.

Let thou the fear of God

Freeze the rebellious blood:

Fasting the flesh control:

Keep watches o'er thy soul,

And pour it forth in prayer:

Such thy true weapons are.

Add tears: and lowly bed,

With reeds or rushes spread:


One constant flame of love

Rising to God above,

And lulling all desire

Which doth not up aspire.

The fallen rise by thee!

The shipwrecked pitied be!

Thyself live out the gale,

Expanding Hope's bright sail.


They fall not who ne'er rise,

But they who try the skies.

Few mount on pinion wings:

Straight course to humbler things.

Fell Lucifer through pride

Angels in heaven reside.

One, traitor, sunk in night:

The eleven are stars of light.


Be pure, be wholly pure,

Of this make ever sure,

Lest thou, by heeding not,

Christ's spotless robe shouldst spot.

Let modest be thine eye:

Thy tongue speak maidenly:

Thy mind not pandering,

Thy foot not wandering:

Nor loud laugh marking thee,

As one we blush to see.


Thy poor and tarnished wear,

Thy unadorn&#232;d hair,

I bonour more than pearls,

Or silken dress, or curls.


Fair flower is modest face,

And paleness is true grace:

And virtues plentiful

Are braid most beautiful.

With paints let others dress

The living God's likeness;

Live tablet they of sin,

And all that's base within.

Whate'er thou hast of beauty,

Die let it all to duty: 

But beauty of the soul--

'Tis God's--it keep thou whole.


Of men, though good they be,

The sight 'twere best thou flee.

Some cheat might thee entrance,

Or be entranced perchance:

Eye now with eye bespangling,

And word with word entangling,

Then cheek with cheek o'erglowing,

And mutual passion flowing.

'Tis well: but not for thee:

Not thine the accursed tree:

The tree of Life thy care;

The serpent's guile beware!


O maiden, hear my word,

Have thou no other lord;

Thy Bridegroom reigns above

And bids thee faithful prove.

133

Thou from the flesh hast fled,

And it to thee is dead,

Why turn to it again,

And make thy work all vain?

That singleness of thine

Is a rare gift divine:

Few they whom it adorns,

As rose among the thorns.

Such grace'tis thine to know:

High o'er the snares below,

By which the wicked fall,

Thou safely passest all.


Lo! one no sooner builds,

And bridal chamber gilds,

Than she with mournful gloom

Forth bears him to the tomb.

Felt one a father's pride?

At once the loved child died.

And oh! the mother's pain

Of travailing in vain!


And jealousy, ah me!

How frightful 'tis to see,

134

When each the other taunts,

Where stolen friendship haunts!


What wormwood and what gall,

Worst recompence of all,

To rear up family,

And then dishonoured be!


One care is thine, one call,

To look to God in all!

But little thou dost need:

That little God will speed.


Shelter and barley cake

Sufficient wealth will make:

Nor shall dire need impart

Keen edge to tempter's dart,

As when Christ, hard bestead,

He bade turn stones to bread.


By thee, however tried,

Be all base gain denied:

Fowls of the air God feeds,

Sure then His saints He heeds.


135

Of oil, if faith prevail,

Thy cruse shall never fail.

By Cherith's desert brook

At the great Prophet look!

To feed him ravens sped:

So too shalt thou be fed!


How Thecla from the flame,

And lions, unscathed came,

Thou know'st: and how great Paul,

Preacher of truth to all,

Bore hunger, thirst, and cold,

Through death's worst forms still bold;

That thou might'st look, O maid,

To God alone for aid,

Who in the wilderness

With food can myriads bless.


Lo! beauty fadeth fast,

Nor will earth's glories last:

Wealth is a failing stream,

And power an empty dream.


But thou, faith's sail unfurled,

Hast fled this erring world,

Steering thy course on high

To realms beyond the sky.

There in the holy shrine

Thou shalt for ever shine:

And there with angels raise

The song of endless praise!


A better portion far

Than sons and daughters are!


But maidens, be ye wise,

And watch with longing eyes,

That when Christ shall return

Your lamps may brightly burn:

That with the Bridegroom ye

May enter in, and see

The beauty and the grace

Of His own dwelling place,

And share in truth and love

The mysteries above.

I have outpoured, Thou first shalt be my song;

May this my word, the current of my mind,

If lawful thus to speak, acceptance find,

And unto Thee as holy incense rise

Of holiest priest, a grateful sacrifice!

The Father's Brightness, Word of the Great Mind,

Who cannot be by power of speech defined,

High Light of highest Light, the Only Son,

Image and Seal of the Immortal One,     

Without beginning; from same Fount of Light

With the Great Spirit; infinite in might:

All-glorious Thou, and Author of all good:

From age to age Thy truth hath firmly stood.

Enthroned Thou reignest high in heaven above,

Almighty Breath of Mind and Lord of Love.

Throughout this fram&#232;d universe Divine

Whatever is, or shall be, all is Thine:

Thou madest all, to all Thou givest life,

And all Thou guidest: nowhere fault or strife,

Nor error in Thy workmanship is found:

The whole in willing chain to Thee is bound.

Thou laid'st the world's foundation: and Thy nod

All things obey, and own their Sovereign God.

For Thee the lofty sun, the king of day,

Quenching the stars, holds on his fiery way.

For Thee, for so Thou bidst, the eye of night,

The moon, waxes and wanes, full orb of light.

For Thee the belt of heaven, all-dancing ring,

And seasons kindly mingling, laugh and sing.

For Thee the fix&#232;d stars and planets shine

In course, and speak Thy wisdom all divine.

Thy light they are, the heavenly minds that be,

All sing on high the glorious Trinity.

Man is Thy glory too, angel below,

Here placed to sing, O Light, Thy beauteous glow.

Immortal, fleshless, glory's highest ray,

Who mortal flesh yet took'st, man's woes to stay,

For Thee I live, for Thee my songs arise,

For Thee I am a breathing sacrifice;

For this, of all things once possessed by me,

Alone remains, and this I give to Thee.


I tie my tongue, and loose it at Thy will;

In either, what Thou wouldst may I fulfil,

Speak what is right, nor think aught else beside:

From mire select the pearl, with Thee my Guide;

Gold from the sand, the rose from thorny brake,

From straw-encumbered ears the pure grain take.


To Thee, O Christ, this wreath of uttered praise,

As firstfruits of my loving toil, I raise.


For from the dead, with whom He mingled lay,

Great Christ arose, upon this gladsome day;

Gates of grim Hades He did open fling;

And broke death's power, and robbed him of his sting;

Rushed from the tomb, appeared to speaking men,

For whom, once born, He died and rose again;

That we new-born might rise, from death set free,

And ever live, ascending Lord, with Thee.

This day glad Heaven with acclamation rings,

And choir angelic crowning anthem sings.

This day my clos&#232;d lips I loose in song

To Thee, to whom my lute and breath belong.


Of mind to Mind, of word to the true Word,

I here have offered what I could afford:

Hereafter, if He will, I hope to bring

To the Great Spirit worthier offering.

And learn from self to cease,&#8212;

Leave all things to our Father&#8217;s will,

And, on His mercy, leaning still,

Find, in each trial, peace!

Through Thy mysterious spirit&#8217;s power,

And of new life partake.

With richer beauty glows

The world, before so fair;

Her holy light religion throws,

Reflected everywhere.

The grave is but the path to heaven,

And death is now our friend.

Must the Christian serve his God;

But the burden of daily life must bear,

And tread where his Saviour trod.

Doth the spirit of prayer abide;

Would an earth-born courage quell,

That once were bowed low.

His holy path he trod;

&#8217;Twas his delight to turn aside

And win the lost to God;

And unto sorrowing guilt disclose

The fount whence peace should flow;

And thus with love to raise up those

That once were bowed low.

O, not with cold, unfeeling eye

Did he the suffering view;

Not on the other side pass by,

And deem their tears untrue;

SHEG,o_soul_of_mine_repining,Songs and Hymns of the Earliest Greek Christian Poets,1876,,"1.

O soul of mine, repining,

What wouldst have done for thee?

Speak, great or small defining:

Granted thy wish shall be.


2.

Of all bright things, prized highest,

Beneath the rolling sun,

Tell that for which thou sighest;

For thee it shall be done.


3.

Wouldst thou assume the measure

Of Gyges, Lydia's king,

To hide or show at pleasure

By power of magic ring?


4.

Wouldst thou rich Midas follow?

""All gold I touch,"" he cried:

'Tis given! e'en gold to swallow:

So all of gold he died.


5.

Wouldst shine in brilliant trammels,

With pearls and jewels grand?

Have flocks, and herds, and camels,

And acres of fat land?


6.

Such things we will not barter:

To thee they were a snare:

They are not in our charter,

Nor would I have them there.


7.

For since to God advancing

I came at His own call,

Such cares the soul entrancing,

I have abandoned all.


8.

Wouldst have the nations bending

Beneath thy yoke to day,

To-morrow thyself lending

To grace another's sway?


9.

The sway of one, once marching,

It might be, at thy side;

Or menial base, now arching

His neck in lofty pride?


10.

Wouldst thou in Love's sweet anguish,

In indolence and ease,

Let truth and honour languish,

And change with changing breeze?


11.

Wouldst wed a fair Heth's daughter,

Fair progeny to see?

Ah me! of woes and slaughter

Progenitor to be!


12.

Wouldst have the commons sounding

The greatness of thy fame,

And theatres rebounding

With echoes of thy name?


13.

Wouldst thou in courts o'erflowing

With legal mockery,

Justice and truth o'erthrowing,

Pillage, and pillaged be?


14.

Wouldst take a martial bearing,

And sport with blood and gore?

Or, Pythian garlands wearing,

Defy the lion's roar?


15.

Wouldst have the town applauding,

And statues reared to thee?

The world thy merits lauding,

Wouldst thou its idol be?


16.

Vain wish! a shadowy dreaming,

A moan of wind hence bound,

Whiz of an arrow gleaming,

A hand-clap's dying sound.


17.

Such things will fade to-morrow,

However bright to-day:

And he must sleep in sorrow

Who makes them his heart's stay.


18.

Toys common! bad men's heaven!

And ah! when hence they go,

To none is it then given

To carry aught below.


19.

What then, O soul repining,

Since these things nothing be,

Substantial good defining,

Wouldst thou have done for thee?


20.

Wouldst be a god, presiding

At God's own side most high,

Angelic chorus guiding,

All radiant o'er the sky?


21.

Go thou, on pinions gliding

Of vehement desire,

On rapid whirlwind riding

Whither thou dost aspire.


22.

To plume thy wing I'm trying,

Nor spare the friendly goad:

Mount upward, bird-like flying

On thine ethereal road.


23.

But earth's own child on crutches,

Since, I am yoked to thee,

As queen in butchers' clutches,

Just tell how this must be;


24.

Whom wilt thou have abettor,

To be upheld in breath?

For I'm no more thy debtor,

Nor heed vain threats of death.


25.

Or wouldst thou perfumed table,

With dainties covered o'er,

So art cuisine be able

To stimulate thee more?


26.

And lyre, and whirl so maddening

Of rapid foot and hand,

And things to tell too saddening,

Known to the revelling band?


27.

Art thou for such things wrangling?

Have thy desire!--but wait:

Such things, not life, but strangling,

To friends insatiate!


28.

For thee, a house abideth,

A rock with self-formed dome;

Nature herself provideth:

We give thee such a home!


29.

Or if thy fancy leadeth

To build thyself a cell,

But little toil it needeth,

Where thou mayst safely dwell,


30.

The body claims small payment,

Ere it returns to dust:

Skins, camel's hair, for raiment

Sufficed of old the just.


31.

And grass, or straw, as chances,

Make thou thy humble bed:

And purple heath, or branches,

Thy coverlet be spread.


32.

Such for my guests is meetest:

No fear to great or small:

Plain table: odours sweetest,

Kind earth's free gifts to all.


33.

Thus housed, we will thee nourish,

As best we can afford:

Wouldst eat? take bread and flourish:

Take meal, if on the board.


34.

Here's salt: and thyme we scant not:

Such source no toil requires:

More luxuries we want not,

Whate'er the world desires.


35.

Or drink wouldst thou? there springeth

An everflowing bowl:

No bane the fountain bringeth,

Bright cheerer of the soul.


36.

But wouldst unbend in season,

And not, o'erstrained, repine?

We grant in this is reason,

Nor grudge the rough-made wine.


37.

But thou dost spurn all measure,

And wouldst the vessel bore,

And take huge draughts of pleasure

Till thou couldst hold no more.


38.

Then seek another helot,

All lengths with thee to go,

No idler I, nor zealot,

To nurse domestic foe.


39.

116

A frozen reptile taken,

And with fond warmth caressed:

See! it to life doth waken,

And wound me in the breast.


40.

Wouldst boundless gold-roofed mansions,

Gemmed paragons of art,

And master-piece expansions,

To life which almost start?


41.

Colours with colours blending

In opposite array;

Rare tablets, softness lending,

Or shining bright as day?


42.

Dost long for robes wide-flowing,

Pride of the untouched great;

And wealth on fingers glowing,

Incredible to state?


43.

117

Art thou at beauty aiming?

The wise would scorn to win:

More I than all, proclaiming

That beauty is within.


44.

Thus I to men benighted,

of earth the creatures fond,

For time alone quick-sighted,

With not a thought beyond.


45.

But ye who soar up higher,

A noble life to live;

Who would to heaven be nigher,

Behold what God doth give!


46.

In poorest clay there dwelleth

That which can never die:

With this my bosom swelleth:

For this I food supply!


47.

God-minded, thyself harden!

Meet calm the flashing sword!

Plant trees for God's own garden!

Be worker, with the Lord!


48.

Up! living words be building,

In God's blest truth secure.

Not robbed by foe's false gilding

Through pleasure's baneful lure!


49.

Again of life eternal,

Approach the bless&#232;d tree

The way, O Thou Supernal,

I've found in knowing Thee.


50.

Past, present, never-ending,

The One great Light in Three;

To whom all things are tending:

To Thee, all glory be!


EPILOGUE.51.

To self the wise thus speaketh,

Turning his eyes within;

And eager there he seeketh

To find out lurking sin.

But who to speak refuseth,

Will pass his days in vain:

Nay, more! the ease he chooseth,

May end in greatest pain.

Eternal singing shall be woven in

Deep sound of golden harps far echoing there

To praise the Lamb who took away our sin;

When far and wide the radiant streets resound

With Hallelujah songs the ransomed sing,

And clouds of sweetest incense rise around

The Throne where sits in light the Saviour King!


Oh what will be the day when we shall see

The Love that opened Heaven to ransomed men!

Love draws us and we followwe are free

Nought severs us from our Belov'd then:

That veil of faith through which we looked of old

Has passed away as mist before the sun;

Christ throned in glory do our eyes behold,

O'er worlds, through ages, reigning ever on.


Oh what will be the day when we shall hear

Come, oh ye blessed! when we take our place

Before His throne in radiance sweet and clear,

Behold His glorious, His belov'd Face

Behold the Eyes whence bitter tears have flowed

For all our grief, our hardness, and our sin

Behold the wounds whence streamed the precious Blood,

Which ransomed us, and washed us pure and clean!


Oh what will be the day when hand in hand,

Saints wander through the pastures green and fair,

The trees of life upon the golden strand

As fresh as on the third day morn are there;

There all is new, and never shall be old,

For time is not, nor age, nor slow decay;

No dying eyes, no hearts grown strange and cold,

All pain, all death, all sighing fled away!


Oh what will be the day when every thought

Of that dark valley we have left below,

And all remembrance of the fight we fought,

Our pilgrim journey, long and sad, and slow,

Shall only make the Glory brighter far,

Shall make the peace but deeper, sweeter yet?

O'er that dark sea was Christ our Guiding Star,

Our love were fainter love could we forget.


Oh what will be that day? no eye can see,

No ear can hear, no heart has yet conceived,

What God shall give us, and what we shall be

When we inherit what we have believed.

O Land of Promise! rough may be the road,

And long the race may bebut sweet the end;

The dead with Christ, the risen sons of God,

With Him we journey, and with Him ascend.

Untiring in your holy fight,

Still treading each temptation down,

And battling for a brighter crown.

Press on, press on! through toil and woe,

With calm resolve, to triumph go,

And make each dark and threatening ill

Yield but a higher glory still.

Press on, press on! still look in faith

To him who vanquished sin and death;

Then shall ye hear God&#8217;s word, &#8220;Well done!&#8221;

The flying cloud, the frosty light:

The year is dying in the night;

Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.

Ring out the old, ring in the new,

Ring, happy bells, across the snow:

The year is going, let him go;

Ring out the false, ring in the true.

Ring out the grief that saps the mind,

For those that here we see no more;

Ring out the feud of rich and poor,

Ring in redress to all mankind.

Ring out false pride in place and blood,

The civic slander and the spite;

Ring in the love of truth and right,

Ring in the common love of good.

Ring out old shapes of foul disease,

Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;

Ring out the thousand wars of old,

Ring in the thousand years of peace.

Ring in the valiant man and free,

The larger heart, the kindlier hand;

Ring out the darkness of the land,

Ring in the Christ that is to be.

Thou didst cause the light to shine;

Thou didst bring Thy sunbeams forth

O&#8217;er Thy new-created earth.

Shade of night and morning ray

Took from Thee the name of day:

Now again the shades are nigh,

Listen to Thy children&#8217;s cry!

May we ne&#8217;er, by guilt depressed,

Lose the way to endless rest;

May no thoughts, corrupt and vain,

Draw our souls to earth again.

Rather help them still to rise

Where our dearest treasure lies;

Help us in our daily strife,

Make us struggle into life!

Turns again home.

In earnest pleading flows;

Devotion dwells upon the theme,

Faith grasps the blessing she desires,

Hope points the upward gaze;

And love, untrembling love, inspires

The eloquence of praise.

But sweeter far the still, small voice,

Heard by no human ear,

When God hath made the heart rejoice,

And dried the bitter tear.

Nor accents flow, nor words ascend;

All utterance faileth there;

But listening spirits comprehend,

And God accepts the prayer.

And all the illumined earth&#8217;s expanse

Inhales the hour.

With conscious blessing, fills the soul,&#8212;

Which metes the whole.

With skill against his toil, he bends,

And finds his work&#8217;s determined scope

To deathless aims his soul may rise,

Each dawn may wake to better life,

With purer eyes.

Renewed with every morning&#8217;s ray,

And freshening still with added flowers

Each future day.

One dayspring&#8217;s beam has dawned below;

From Thine our inmost glories are,

With Thine we glow.

Hail! Christ the Life, unchanging Day,

Accept this humble virgin lay:

To Thee our song of praise

With heart and voice we raise!

In Thee, O Thou perfection's flower, O Word Divine,

Love, joy, mind, wisdom, shine.


THE REFRAIN.

With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,

O Bride, triumphant now in light,

And clad in robes of purest white,

Ope wide the gates to me:

And sing thy marriage, Love!

Ah me! some virgins vainly pour

Their sobs and cries outside the door:

Their lamps are quenched, and they

No burning light display:

Their error they would mend: but ah! they come too late,

And clos&#232;d is the gate.


THE REFRAIN.

With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,

And from the sacred pathway strayed;

Forbidden with dead lamps the home of bliss to see,

They wail their misery.

The Bridegroom doth prepare.


THE REFRAIN.

First type, O Bless&#232;d One, of Thee

In Abel shining bright we see:

Blood-dripping, and thus cries:

""Me, by my cruel brother slain, receive, O Lord,

O Thou the Eternal Word.""

By, shameless woman; stripped, he yet her wrath defied,

And straight to Thee he cried:


THE REFRAIN.

With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,

I go to meet my Lord returning.


A lamb for sacrifice is sought:

A lamb-like victim Jephthah brought:

For rash-made vow he cared,

Nor virgin daughter spared:

A type, O Bless&#232;d One, of Thy humanity,

She poured her soul to Thee:

In valour Judith holds high post:

The leader of the oppressing host

She smote by beauty's lure,

Herself a type all pure:

He headless lay; and unto Thee the conquering maid

Her love in song displayed:


THE REFRAIN.

With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,

I go to meet my Lord returning.


The Judges twain, by passion's flame

Enkindled, and all dead to shame,

Would chaste Susannah bind

To their unhallowed mind:

To their proposals base she gave a just reply:

And raised her voice on high:


THE REFRAIN.

With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,

I go to meet my Lord returning.


16.

'Twere better far that I should die,

Than traitress be to marriage tie,

And yielding to your will

Both soul and body kill:

Base men! God's fire of wrath eternal would me seize:

Save me, O Christ, from these!


THE REFRAIN.

With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,

I go to meet my Lord returning.


And he who thousands washed from sin,

Of Thy true light the bringer-in,

For virtue's cause alone

Is into prison thrown

By wicked king: and staining now the ground with gore,

He cried to Thee the more:


THE REFRAIN.

And Thy blest Mother, spotless maid,

Was thought her vows to have betrayed,

When travailing with Thee,

O Lord of purity:

And found with child of transcendental heavenly birth,

She raised her voice from earth:


THE REFRAIN.

With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,

I go to meet my Lord returning.


Thy saints, all eager that they may

Behold the glories of the day

Of Thine espousals high,

With holy gifts draw nigh:

For Thou, O Word, hast called them, Thou the angels' King:

White-robed to Thee they sing.


THE REFRAIN.

With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,

I go to meet my Lord returning.


20.

O holy Church, O heavenly Bride,

With hymns, attending at Thy side,

We yet on earth below

Thine honour thus forth-show:

All snow-white thou, all beauteous spouse of Christ above,

All purity, all love.


THE REFRAIN.

With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,

I go to meet my Lord returning.


Past are corruption, sickness, pain;

Nor tears shall ever flow again;

For troubles all have fled;

And death himself is dead:

And sin and folly with dark dismal train are gone,

Since grace in glory shone.


THE REFRAIN.

With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,

I go to meet my Lord returning.


22.

No longer Paradise of men

Is void; for there God wills again

That man should safely dwell;

Yea, man the same who fell

Beneath the serpent's wiles: now in the promised rest,

Immortal, fearless, blest.


THE REFRAIN.

With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,

I go to meet my Lord returning.


Thou now to heavenly places raised,

By all the virgin choir art praised,

O Bride of Heavenly King:

And song all new we sing:

With lighted torch in hand, with snow-white lilies crowned,

Thy praise in Christ we sound.


THE REFRAIN.

With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,

I go to meet my Lord returning.


24.

Father of heaven, supreme in might,

Dwelling in pure eternal light

With Thine own Son most dear,

Admit--for we are here--

E'en us within the gates of life, to sing Thy love

In Thy blest courts above.

Of perfect bliss and love.

And now it dies, and now fresh life recalls.

It, wretched, hither now, now hither goes.

How things have strayed in dire perplexity

Far from Thy Breath: how floods of evil roll,

And in base matter overwhelm the soul!

Escape it seeks from bitter woe all round,

But knows not where a passage may be found.

O Father, Me upon this errand send:

Bearing Thy seals, I will the depths descend;

Throughout whole ages I will make my way,

All mysteries of darkness turn to day;

From new to old again;

The struggles of the strong,

Are steps towards some happy goal,

The story of hope&#8217;s song.

Hope leads the child to plant the flower,

The man to sow the seed;

Nor leaves fulfilment to her hour,&#8212;

But prompts again to deed.

And ere upon the old man&#8217;s dust

The grass is seen to wave,

We look through falling tears, to trust

Hope&#8217;s sunshine on the grave.

O, no! it is no flattering lure,

No fancy weak or fond,

When hope would bid us rest secure

In better life beyond.

Nor love, nor shame, nor grief, nor sin,

Her promise may gainsay;

The voice divine hath spoke within,

And God did ne&#8217;er betray.

To Thee at growth of day,

To Thee at noon, to Thee at vesper hour,

And when now fades the light,

And poured forth is the night,

(Both night and day are Thine, and show Thy power),

I sing, O Healer of the soul,

And of the body too: Thou only mak'st it whole.


II. (10-17).


And wisdom's spring Thou art,

And dost of it impart;

And Thou dost drive diseases far away,

And unto souls dost give

Untroubled life to live,

Which earthly care may not stamp down nor sway,

Who mother is of pain and woe,

And all the thousand ills that culminate below.


III. (18-27).

From which O grant to me

My life be ever free!

That I may praise in thankful hymn and song

The hidden Root of all,

Nor severed be, nor fall

From God, through ills that to this world belong.

To Thee, O Father Bless&#232;d, I will sing,

Who art of this great universe the glorious King.


IV. (28-37).


Hushed be the world, and still,

While I my task fulfil,

And lift to Thee, Supreme, the hymn divine;

And while my prayers I pour,

Let all on earth adore!

For earth, and all her workmanship, is Thine.

Let blustering winds their tumults cease,

And rustling trees and shrill-voiced birds be all at peace.


V. (38-48).

Let ether listener be

To holy psalmody:

Let air be silent too: and rapid streams

Adown the earth that pour,

And waves that lash the shore,

Let all be stayed, as it in prayer beseems.

And demon foes to holy strain,

Who haunt recesses dark, and in the tombs remain;


VI. (49-59)


Fly they--far, far away--

While I my offerings pay:

But all the good, throughout creation's range,

The happy ones who serve,

Nor from the precepts swerve

Of the Great Parent, now in interchange

Of holy thought and mind may they

Befriend, and upward these my hymns and prayers convey!


VII. (60-67).

The One, the only One,

The Father Thou alone,

The One beginning whence all else began;

The Fount whence all founts flow,

The Root whence all roots grow;

The Good whence good in all its channels ran;

The Star that to all stars gave birth;

The World whence sprang all worlds from highest heaven to earth.


VIII. (68-79).


The Form of all forms known:

All beauty is Thine own:

The hidden Seed, the ages' Parent Prop:

Of worlds intelligent

The Father, whence forth sent

Ambrosial Breath, and floating drop by drop

Upon embodied bulk, combines

A second world, which in reflected glory shines.


IX. (80-88).

O Bless&#232;d, Thee I praise,

Or whether voice I raise,

Or solemn silence keep; for to Thine ear

Not more the uttered speech

Than Mind's still voice doth reach:

Unuttered though the word, yet Thou dost hear.

With Thee I praise the First-born One,

The First-sprung Light, Thine own Begotten only Son.


X. (89-95).


Thou Lord of power and might,

Light of the Father light,

Of the Ineffable the glorious Word;

With the great Father Thee

I hymn in unity;

And Holy Spirit too in blest accord,

Who did Himself divinely spring

Forth from the Father and through Thee, with Thee I sing.


XI. (96-109).

True counsel He unfolds

And middle rule He holds:

Breath holy! Spur of Father, Spur of Son!

Self-Parent, and Self-Kin,

Self-nurtured Root within,

The Uncreated, Unbegotten One.

The Eternal glory is out-poured

Upon the Son: through whom forth springs the Spirit Lord.


XII. (110-124).


God and of God is He,

Mid light in Trinity.

Thee Trinity and Unity we name;

For Thou art Three, yet One,

The Father, Spirit, Son:

Though severed, yet unsevered, One the same.

Forth went the Son to do Thy will,

And yet with Thee the Father He remaineth still.


XIII. (125-135).

Thy rule to bear He goes,

And upon worlds bestows,

Whence He Himself received, life's happy store.

The Word! to Thee I raise

With the Great Father, praise.

The Mind of the Ineffable, before

All worlds, did Thee beget; and Thou

Begotten art the Father's Word, to whom all bow!


XIV. (136-146).


Thou first from the first Root

Didst spring, the glorious Shoot;

And since Thy birth all things have birth from Thee.

The Eternal One, the Seed

Of all things, so decreed,

That Thou, first-sown, the Seed of all shouldst be.

For Thou dost all in all fulfil;

And 'tis by Thee that nature lived and liveth still;


XV. (147-159).

Where she is highest seen,

Where in the ranks between,

Where lowest: all good gifts of quickening powers

From God the Father she

Doth taste and hold through Thee.

Guided by Thee, this ageless sphere of ours

Turns her strong wheels on easy poles,

And seventh in the dance of stars unwearied rolls.


XVI. (160-170).


The many lights on high

One surface beautify

In Thy great world: for Thou dost so ordain:

And Thou, God's glorious Son,

Didst make the ages run,

And in unbroken course dost them sustain.

All in this globe Thou dost survey,

And all in circuit tend; and all Thy laws obey.


XVII. (171-180).

And in the depths of sky

Unfathomed we descry

Thy ruling hand and power; for it is there

That Thou the stars dost lead,

And in Light's pastures feed

The glittering host, with a true Shepherd's care.

To all in heaven, in earth, below,

Thou dost their tasks assign, and life on all bestow.


XVIII. (181-192).


To gods and mortal kind,

Whoe'er have quaffed of mind,

By kindly fate, the intellectual shower,

Thou Lord and Steward art:

And soul Thou dost impart

To those whose life hath nought but soul for dower,

And nature's unrestrained control

For hangs on Thee the growth of even eyeless soul.


XIX. (193-212).

And things that lack Thy breath

Are yet upheld from death;

For Thou hast linked them to the One Supreme:

Whence flows to earth by Thee

Life's channel still kept free

Through trackless worlds; and the descending stream

Of good doth mould this world of ours

To form of unseen world of highest mental powers.


XX. (213-226).


A second sun hath shone

This lower world upon:

Parent of later light: and bright-eyed lord

Of what doth live to-day,

To-morrow to decay,

Base matter: he doth yet to us afford

All world-born good, by Thy decree;

And is, O Thou God-born, type visible of Thee.


XXI. (227-237).

Beyond mind's utmost reach,

Beyond all power of speech,

Ineffable, unknown, O Father dread!

Thou art of mind the Mind,

Of souls the Soul combined,

Of natures all Thou art the Fountain-head.

Behold! Thy servant bends the knee,

And down on earth a poor blind suppliant falls to Thee.


XXII. (238-250).


But Thou the light dost give,

The light for mind to live;

To suppliant soul, O Bless'd, pity show:

Diseases chase away,

And cares the soul which slay,

And shameless earthly dog, and fiendish foe:

Far from my soul and from my prayer,

Far from my life and deeds, chase every hurtful snare.


XXIII. (252-259).

Armed may my body be

Against the enemy,

And armed my spirit, and whate'er is mine;

Nor may he entrance find

Within my heart or mind.

Out be he cast, and out, by help Divine,

Remain, and leave me, and take flight,

The worldly fiend, who gives to passions strength and might.


XXIV. (260-274).


And who obstructs the road

Which upward leads to God;

And quencheth aspiration's holy flame.

But, O great King, give me,

Companion meet to be,

An angel of Thine own, of holy name,

Of holy aid, an angel friend,

Who may God-lighted prayer, and all good deeds defend.


XXV. (275-280).

A guardian may he be

Of soul and life to me,

And to my prayer and deeds protection yield;

My body may he save

From trouble's rushing wave,

And sickness; and from harm my spirit shield,

And o'er my soul oblivion pour

Of earthly passions which disturbed my peace before.


XXVI. (281-290).


So may I spend my life

All calm and free from strife!

So may my soul, in hymning Thy high praise,

Mount up with strengthened wing

From earth, and heavenward spring!

So may I cleanse from worldliness my ways,

Till I, set free from earth-bound chain,

No longer subject am to Fate's imperious reign;


XXVII. (291-299).

But gain those halls above,

And Thy blest folds of love,

Whence forth doth flow the fountain of the soul!

But Thou propitious be,

And helping hand give me!

Call me, O Bless&#232;d! all my ways control!

Hear Thou Thy humble suppliant's cry,

And lift my soul from earth to native realms on high!

SHEG,to_thee_much_loved_be_honour_paid,Songs and Hymns of the Earliest Greek Christian Poets,1876,,"To Thee, much loved, be honour paid,

O glorious Child of Hebrew maid!

To Thee I raise the hymn anew,

Who didst the serpent's wiles subdue,

And drive afar the infernal foe

That filled e'en Paradise with woe:

For, subtle with forbidden fruit,

Of woeful knowledge nurse and root,

Our primal founder he o'ercame,

And smote the world with death and shame.

All-glorious Thou with many a crown!

Thou didst to wretched earth come down,

To dwell with man by death assailed,

Thyself in mortal body veiled;

And Thou dark Tartarus didst tread,

Midst countless nations of the dead,

Then Hades, ancient-born, amazed,

Did shudder as on Thee he gazed;

And the all-devouring savage hound

Backward recoiled with frightened bound.

But lo! to holy souls, oppressed

With direful woes, Thou gavest rest,

That they in chorus led by Thee,

To praise the Father might be free.

And from below when Thou didst rise,

The demon-hosts beneath the skies,

Unnumbered, quaked, O mighty King,

To hear the judgment Thou shouldst bring.

Then did the stars, immortal band,

Gazing at Thee, astonished stand.

But Ether laughed, the father he--

The father wise--of harmony;

And mingled from his seven-toned lyre

Bright notes of music's holy fire,

Raising to Lord of earth and sky,

The song of victory on high.

And Lucifer, the guide of day,

With smiling countenance was gay;

And golden Hesperus afar

Shot beams, the Cythere&#239;an star.

And shepherdess of right, the Moon

Filled her bright crescent with festoon,

And flowering wreath of liquid fire,

And led her peers in joyous choir.

And through the trackless paths of air

Titan spread out his flaming hair:

For God's own Son, the master Mind

Which did all things create and bind

In mutual law, full well he knew,

From whom his primal fire he drew.

But Thou, as plying heavenly oar,

Or wing of bird, didst upward soar

With holy feet; and o'er the skies

And dark-blue-vaulted heaven didst rise,

Up-mounting to the spheres of light,

The realms of Mind for ever bright.

There goodness from the Fountain-head

In bliss through silent heaven is spread;

There nor deep-flowing restless Time

Drags earthborn children through the slime

Of coarser matter, nor hard fates

Roll turbid floods o'er mortal states;

But Age himself, the ancient-sprung,

Is ageless, old at once, and young;

And in the unfading courts of love

is steward to the blest above.

And the palm is ever waving,

4 Where the Lamb on high is seated,

Lord of lords, and King of kings.

Son of Man, they crown, they crown Him,

Son of God, they own, they own Him;

With His Name the palace rings.

Heavenly riches, earthly treasure,

Lay we at His bless'd feet;

Poor the praise that now we render,

Loud shall be our voices yonder,

When before His throne we meet.


Amen."
SHEG,wake_wake_i_pray_thee_shrilltoned_lyre,Songs and Hymns of the Earliest Greek Christian Poets,1876,,"Wake, wake, I pray thee, shrill-toned lyre!

No more to fan the Te&#239;an fire,

No more the Lesbian strain to raise,

Wake, wake to hymn of nobler praise!

Sound Dorian ode, in other guise,

Than once to maid with laughing eyes,

Or youth whose form and golden tresses

Might woo the wanton air's caresses!

A better theme inspires my song,

And bears my soul far hence along.

A Virgin's God-conceiving throes,

Wisdom's own cure for mortal woes--


This bids me now my harp-strings ply,

And earth's black loves and miseries fly.

For what is strength, or beauty's sway,

Or gold, or fame--what doth it weigh--

Or royal honours--in the scale?

What these 'gainst search for God avail?

Let this man urge the well-horsed car,

That shoot the true-aimed arrow far;

Another watch o'er golden heap,

And safe his hoarded treasure keep;

To one be pride of glossy hair

Flowing o'er neck in wavelets fair;

Another court the favouring glances

Of boys and girls in hymns and dances.

Not such for me! But this I pray,

Unknown to spend life's quiet day;

To this vain world unmarked, unknown,

But God's truth knowing as my own.

Wisdom present herself to me!

Good guide of youth and age is she,

Of wealth good stewardess and queen,

Alike in poverty serene;

Beyond earth's sorrows smiling gay,

To calm content she points the way.


That priceless wisdom first I ask,

To guide and sweeten all life's task,

And then sufficient humble store

To keep me from my neighbour's door;

That I may ne'er, oppressed with need,

Harbour dark thoughts of selfish greed.


Hark! 'tis the sweet cicada's song:

He drinks the dew, and chirps along.

And, lo! my strings unbidden sound,

And here and there a voice around!

What in the world--what melody

Will pang divine bring forth to me?


'Tis so! Self-sprung Beginning He,

50Father and Lord of all that be:

Not made, not born, on high alone

He hath o'er lofty heaven His throne.

There glory changeless He displays,

And sceptre there eternal sways;

Of unities pure Unity,

And Sole of sole existence He!

High ether pure He did combine,

And quicken into Life Divine.


He then, ere yet the ages ran,

In mode ineffable to man, 

The Godhead through the Firstborn poured:

Hence Three, yet One, the Triune Lord.


And now the heavenly fount around

Behold, with children's beauty crowned,

Forth from the centre as they spring,

Or round it flow in joyous ring.


But stop, rash lyre, thy lofty flight,

Nor touch things hid from mortal sight!

To men below it is not given

To tell high mystic rites of heaven.

The things beneath do thou reveal;

The things above let silence seal.


But Mind now cares for worlds alone,

In which reflected mind is shown:

A good beginning this we sing,

For thence man's spirit hath its spring:

For now to matter came there down

Mind incorruptible, high crown,

Severed in each, and fragment small,

Yet true descent from God of all.

This whole, in every part one-centred,

Whole into whole as it hath entered,

Takes station at the eternal poles,

And heaven's resplendent circle rolls.

Divided next, to those again,

In given form who yet retain

Their dowry unimpaired of mind,

There are high offices assigned;

The chariot race of stars one guides,

One o'er the angelic choir presides.

But, ah! another, empty, vain,

Self-dragged by down-inclining chain,

Hath found a form of lower earth,

Deep fallen from his heavenly birth:

From home apostate far he flew,

And cups of Lethe's darkness drew;

Of eyeless soul and murky mind,

To heaven's true joy and glory blind;

Fain he to joyless earth repaired,

A god by mortal things ensnared.

All dark! yet, lo! to mortal eyes

A ray of cheering light doth rise!

A door of hope is opened high,

And helping hand is stretched out nigh,

To lift the fallen here on earth

Back to the honours of their birth,

When they, emerging from the strife

And din and cares of storm-tossed life,

To holy paths have turned indeed,

Which to their Father's palace lead.

Blest he who from the entangling mesh

Of matter and of greedy flesh

Hath fled, and on with springing bound

The upward way to God hath found!

Blest he who, after fates severe,

And toils and many a bitter tear,

And all the crowd of anxious cares

Which earth to all her votaries shares,

To mind's true course at length restored,

Hath God's own shining depth explored!


A task it is, to lift above

Whole outstretched soul in new-born love

Yet only make determined start,

With wings of mind and honest heart,

And nigh to thee will He appear

With stretched-forth hands, thy Father dear.

Before will run a shining light,

And all thy upward paths make bright:

Fields of sweet thought thou now shalt tread,

Pledge of true beauty, for thee spread!

Come, O my soul, and drink of this,

A fountain flowing with all bliss;

And to thy Father, lifting prayer,

Without delay, up-mount the air.

Leaving to earth the things of earth,

In God assert thy godlike birth;

And mingling with thy Father, Friend,

Taste joys above that never end.

Profane the Almighty&#8217;s name,

The soul of love be poured,

As swells some strain of various parts,

Yet all in sweet accord.

Our fathers built to God;

Their dust endears the sod.

From many a radiant face,

And prayers of tender hope have spread

A perfume through the place.

And anxious hearts have pondered here

The mystery of life,

And prayed the Eternal Spirit clear

Their doubts and aid their strife.

From humble tenements around

Came up the pensive train,

And in the church a blessing found,

Which filled their homes again.

For faith, and peace, and mighty love,

That from the Godhead flow,

Showed them the life of heaven above

Springs from the life below.

They live with God, their homes are dust;

But here their children pray,

And, in this fleeting lifetime, trust

To find the narrow way.

On him Thy blessing fall!

Speak through his lips Thy pure commands,

Thou Heart, that lovest all!

(Ed. B),1898,Gender Neutral,"1 While o'er the deep Thy servants sail,

Send Thou, O Lord, the prosperous gale;

And on their hearts, where'er they go,

O let Thy heavenly breezes blow.


2 If on the morning's wings they fly,

They will not pass beyond Thine eye:

The wanderer's prayer Thou bend'st to hear,

And faith exults to know Thee near.


3 When tempests rock the groaning bark,

Oh, hide them safe in Jesus' ark!

When in the tempting port they ride

Oh, keep them safe at Jesus' side!


4 If life's wide ocean smile or roar,

Still guide them to the heavenly shore;

And grant their dust in Christ may sleep,

Abroad, at home or in the deep.


Amen.

TH1961,yes_for_me_for_me_he_careth,Trinity Hymnal,1961,,"Yes, for me, for me he careth

With a brother's tender care;

Yes, with me, with me he shareth

Ev'ry burden, ev'ry fear.

Yes, o'er me, o'er me he watcheth,

Ceaseless watcheth, night and day;

Yes, e'en me, e'en me he snatcheth

From the perils of the way.

Yes, for me, he standeth pleading

At the mercy seat above;

Ever for me interceding,

Constant in untiring love.

Yes, in me, in me he dwelleth;

I in him, and he in me!

And my empty soul he filleth,

Here and through eternity."

BHPPD866,yes_prayer_is_strong_and_god_is_good,A Book of Hymns for Public and Private Devotion (15th ed.),1866,,"Yes! prayer is strong, and God is good;

Man is not made for endless ill;

The offending soul, in darkest mood,

Hath yet a hope, a refuge still.

Thou, God, wilt hear; these pangs are meant

To heal the spirit, not destroy;

And even remorse, for chastening sent,

When Thou commandest, works for joy.

HAGA1895,yet_there_is_room_the_lambs_bright_hall_,The Hymnal: published by the Authority of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.,1895,Gender Neutral,"1 ""Yet there is room:"" the Lamb's bright hall of song,

With its fair glory, beckons thee along:

Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.


2 Day is declining, and the sun is low;

The shadows lengthen, light makes haste to go:

Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.


3 The bridal hall is filling for the feast;

Pass in, pass in, and be the Bridegroom's guest:

Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.


4 It fills, it fills, that hall of jubilee!

Make haste, make haste, 'tis not too full for thee:

Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.


5 Yet there is room: still open stands the gate,

The gate of love; it is not yet too late:

Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.


6 O enter in; that banquet is for thee;

That cup of everlasting joy is free:

Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.


7 All heaven is there, all joy! Go in, go in;

The angels beckon thee the prize to win:

Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.


8 Louder and sweeter sounds the loving call;

Come, lingerer, come; enter that festal hall:

Room, room, still room! O enter, enter now.


9 Ere night that gate may close, and seal thy doom;

Then the last low, long cry, ""No room, no room!""

No room, no room! O woeful cry, ""No room!""


Amen."
