1 Father, who the light this day


Out of darkness didst create,


Shine upon us now, we pray,


While within Thy courts we wait;


Wean us from the works of night,


Make us children of the light.



2 Savior, who this day didst break


From the bondage of the tomb,


Bid our slumb'ring souls awake,


And dispel their doubt and gloom;


Let us, from our bonds set free,


Rise from sin and live to Thee.



3 Blessed Spirit, Comforter,


Sent this day from Christ on high,


Lord, on us Thy gifts confer,


Cleanse, illumine, sanctify;


All Thine influence shed abroad;


Lead us to the truth of God.
