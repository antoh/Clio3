1 Through the love of God our Savior,


all will be well;


free and changeless is his favor,


all, all is well;


precious is the blood that healed us,


perfect is the grace that sealed us,


strong the hand stretched out to shield us,


all must be well.



2 Though we pass through tribulation,


all will be well;


ours is such a full salvation,


all, all is well;


happy, still in God confiding,


fruitful, if in Christ abiding,


holy through the Spirit's guiding,


all must be well.



3 We expect a bright tomorrow,


all will be well;


faith can sing through days of sorrow,


all, all is well;


on our Father's love relying,


Jesus every need supplying,


or in living or in dying,


all must be well.
