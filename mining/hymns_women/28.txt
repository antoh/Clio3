1 The only Son from heaven,


Foretold by ancient seers,


By God the Father given,


In human shape appears;


No sphere His light confining,


No star so brightly shining


As He, our Morning Star.



2 O time of God appointed,


O bright and holy morn!


He comes, the King anointed,


The Christ, the Virgin-born,


His home on earth He maketh,


And man of heav'n partaketh,


Of life again an heir.



3 O Lord, our hearts awaken


To know and love Thee more,


In faith to stand unshaken,


In Spirit to adore,


That we, still heav'nward hasting,


Yet here Thy joy foretasting,


May reap its fullness there.
