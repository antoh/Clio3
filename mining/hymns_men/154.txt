Yes! prayer is strong, and God is good;

Man is not made for endless ill;

The offending soul, in darkest mood,

Hath yet a hope, a refuge still.

Thou, God, wilt hear; these pangs are meant

To heal the spirit, not destroy;

And even remorse, for chastening sent,

When Thou commandest, works for joy.
