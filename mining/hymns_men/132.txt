Source of light and life divine!

Thou didst cause the light to shine;

Thou didst bring Thy sunbeams forth

O'er Thy new-created earth.

Shade of night and morning ray

Took from Thee the name of day:

Now again the shades are nigh,

Listen to Thy children's cry!

May we ne'er, by guilt depressed,

Lose the way to endless rest;

May no thoughts, corrupt and vain,

Draw our souls to earth again.

Rather help them still to rise

Where our dearest treasure lies;

Help us in our daily strife,

Make us struggle into life!
