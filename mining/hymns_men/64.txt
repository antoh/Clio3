1. Searcher of hearts, from mine erase


All tho'ts that should not be,


And in its deep recesses trace


My gratitude to Thee.



2. Hearer of prayer, O guide aright


Each word and deed of mine;


Life's battle teach me how to fight,


And be the vict'ry Thine.



3. Giver of all--for ev'ry good


In the Redeemer came--


For raiment, shelter, and for food,


I thank Thee in His Name.



4. Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost,


Thou glorious Three in One,


Thou knowest best what I need most,


And let Thy will be done.
