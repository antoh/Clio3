Feeble, helpless, how shall I

Learn to live and learn to die?

Who, O God, my guide shall be?

Who shall lead thy child to Thee?

Blessed Father, gracious One,

Thou hast sent thy holy Son;

He will give the light I need,

He my trembling steps will lead.

Through this world, uncertain, dim,

Let me ever learn of him;

From his precepts wisdom draw,

Make his life my solemn law.

Thus in deed, and thought, and word,

Led by Jesus Christ the Lord,

In my weakness, thus shall I

Learn to live and learn to die;

Learn to live in peace and love,

Like the perfect ones above;&#8212;

Learn to die without a fear,

Feeling Thee, my Father, near.
