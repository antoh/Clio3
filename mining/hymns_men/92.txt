1 He has come, the Christ of God:


Left for us His glad abode;


Stooping from His throne of bliss


To this darksome wilderness.



2 He has come, the Prince of Peace:


Come to bid our sorrows cease;


Come to scatter with His light


All the shadows of our night.



3 He, the mighty King, has come,


Making this poor earth His home:


Come to bear our sin's sad load,


Son of David, Son of God.



4 He has come, whose Name of grace


Speaks deliverance to our race:


Left for us His glad abode,


Son of Mary, Son of God.



5 Unto us a Child is born:


Ne'er has earth beheld a morn


Among all the morns of time,


Half so glorious in its prime.



6 Unto us a Son is given:


He has come from God's own heaven,


Bringing with Him from above


Holy peace and holy love.



Amen.
