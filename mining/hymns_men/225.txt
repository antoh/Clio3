O God! the darkness roll away

Which clouds the human soul,

And let the bright, the perfect day,

Speed onward to its goal.

Let every hateful passion die,

Which makes of brethren foes;

And war no longer raise its cry,

To mar the world's repose.

Let faith, and hope, and charity,

Go forth through all the earth;

And man, in heavenly bearing, be

True to his heavenly birth.

Yea, let Thy glorious kingdom come

Of holiness and love,

And make this world a portal meet

For Thy bright courts above.
