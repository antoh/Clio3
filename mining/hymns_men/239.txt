In the morning I will pray

For God's blessing on the day;

What this day shall be my lot,

Light or darkness, know I not.

Should it be with clouds o'ercast,

Clouds of sorrow, gathering fast,

Thou, who givest light divine,

Shine within me, Lord, O, shine!

Show me, if I tempted be,

How to find all strength in Thee,

And a perfect triumph win

Over every bosom sin.

Keep my feet from secret snares,

Keep mine eyes, O God, from tears!

Every step Thy love attend,

And my soul from death defend!
