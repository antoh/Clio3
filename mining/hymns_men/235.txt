Unto Thy temple, God of love,

Once more we come with willing feet,

To raise our thoughts this world above,

And Thy paternal blessing meet.

May all Thy purest presence feel,

And silent keep each vain desire;

With humble hearts before Thee kneel,

And unto holier strength aspire.

May all be bound in bonds more true

To Thee, who art our life and light,

That through each path which we pursue,

We still may keep Thy love in sight.

And may we, when the day shall close,

Review its course without a fear;

And, nearer heaven than when it rose,

Feel it is good to have been here.
