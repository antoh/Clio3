1 God the All-terrible! King, who ordainest


Great winds Thy clarion, the lightnings Thy sword;


Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest,


Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.



2 God the Omnipotent, Mighty Avenger,


Watching invisible, judging unheard,


Save us in mercy, O save us from danger;


Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.



2 God the All-merciful! Earth hath forsaken


Thy ways of blessedness, slighted Thy word;


Bid not Thy wrath in its terrors awaken;


Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.



3 God the All-righteous One! man hath defied thee;


Yet to eternity standeth thy word,


Falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside thee;


Give to us peace in our time, O Lord.



4 So shall Thy children with thankful devotion,


Laud Him who saved them from peril abhorred;


Singing in chorus, from ocean to ocean,


Peace to the nations, and praise to the Lord.



Amen.
