1 O Lord of Hosts! Almighty King!


Behold the sacrifice we bring:


To every arm Thy strength impart;


Thy Spirit shed through every heart.



2 Wake in our breasts the living fires,


The holy faith that warmed our sires;


Thy hand hath made our nation free;


To die for her is serving Thee.



3 Be Thou a pillared flame to show


The midnight snare, the silent foe;


And when the battle thunders loud,


Still guide us in its moving cloud.



4 God of all nations! Sovereign Lord!


In Thy dread Name we draw the sword,


We lift the starry flag on high


That fills with light our stormy sky.



5 From treason's rent, from murder's stain,


Guard Thou its folds till peace shall reign,


Till fort and field, till shore and sea,


Join our loud anthem, praise to Thee1



Amen.
