A voice upon the midnight air,

Where Kedron's moonlit waters stray,

Weeps forth in agony of prayer,

O Father, take this cup away!

Ah, thou who sorrowst unto death,

We conquer in thy mortal fray;

And earth for all her children saith,

O God, take not this cup away!

O Lord of sorrow, meekly die;

Thou lt heal or hallow all our woe;

Thy peace shall still the mourner's sigh;

Thy strength shall raise the faint and low.

Great chief of faithful souls, arise;

None else can lead the martyr band,

Who teach the soul how peril flies,

When faith, unarmed, uplifts the hand.

O King of earth, the cross ascend;

O'er climes and ages 'tis thy throne;

Where'er thy fading eye may bend,

The desert blooms and is thine own.

Thy parting blessing, Lord, we pray;

Make but one fold below, above;

And when we go the last, lone way,

O, give the welcome of thy love.
