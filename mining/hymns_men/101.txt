1 O Everlasting Light,


Giver of dawn and day,


Dispeller of the ancient night


In which creation lay;



2 O Everlasting Light,


Shine graciously within;


Brightest of all on earth that's bright,


Come, shine away my sin.



3 O Everlasting Truth,


Truest of all that's true,


Sure guide of erring age and youth,


Lead me, and teach me too.



4 O Everlasting Strength,


Uphold me in the way;


Bring me, in spite of foes, at length


To joy and light and day.



5 O Everlasting Love,


Wellspring of grace and peace,


Pour down Thy fulness from above,


Bid doubt and trouble cease.



6 O Everlasting Rest,


Lift off life's load of care;


Relieve, revive this burdened breast,


And every sorrow bear.



7 Thou art in heaven our All,


Our All on earth art Thou;


Upon Thy gracious Name we call,


Lord Jesus, bless us now.



Amen.
