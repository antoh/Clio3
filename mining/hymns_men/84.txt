1 Blessed night, when first that plain,


Echoed with the joyful strain:


'Peace has come to earth again.'



2 Bless'd hills that heard the song


Of the glorious angel throng


Swelling all your slopes along.



3 Happy shepherds on whose ear


Fell the tidings glad and clear,


'God to man is drawing near.'



4 Thus revealed to shepherd's eyes,


Hidden from the great and wise,


Entering earth in lowly guise--



5 We adore Thee as our King,


And to Thee our song we sing;


Our best offering to Thee bring.



6 Bless'd Babe of Bethlehem,


Owner of earth's diadem,


Claim and wear the radiant gem.



Amen.
