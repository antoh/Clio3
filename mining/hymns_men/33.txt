1 We bless Thee, Jesus Christ our Lord;


Forever be Thy name adored:


For Thou, the sinless One, hast died,


That sinners might be justified.



2 O very Man, and very God,


Who hast redeemed us with Thy blood;


From death eternal set us free,


And make us one with God in Thee.



3 From sin and shame defend us still,


And work in us Thy steadfast will,


The cross with patience to sustain,


And bravely bear its utmost pain.



4 In Thee we trust, in Thee alone;


For Thou forsakest not Thine own;


To all the meek Thy strength is giv'n,


Who by Thy cross ascend to heav'n.
