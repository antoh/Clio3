1 Behold the Lamb of God!


O Thou for sinners slain,


Let it not be in vain


That Thou hast died:


Thee for my Saviour let me take,


My only refuge let me make


Thy pierc'd Side.



2 Behold the Lamb of God!


Into the sacred flood


Of Thy most precious Blood


My soul I cast:


Wash me and make me clean within,


And keep me pure from every sin,


Till life be past.



3 Behold the Lamb of God!


All hail, Incarnate Word,


Thou everlasting Lord,


Saviour most blest;


Fill us with love that never faints,


Grant us with all Thy bless'd Saints,


Eternal rest.



4 Behold the Lamb of God!


Worthy is He alone,


That sitteth on the throne


Of God above;


One with the Ancient of all days,


One with the Comforter in praise,


All Light and Love.
