1 Great King of nations, hear our prayer,


While at Thy feet we fall,


And humbly, with united cry,


To Thee for mercy call.



2 The guilt is ours, but grace is Thine,


O turn us not away;


But hear us from Thy lofty throne,


And help us when we pray.



3 Our fathers' sins were manifold,


And ours no less we own,


Yet wondrously from age to age


Thy goodness has been shown.



4 When dangers, like a stormy sea,


Beset our country round,


To Thee we looked, to Thee we cried,


And help in Thee was found.



5 With one consent we meekly bow


Beneath Thy chastening hand,


And, pouring forth confession meet,


Mourn with our mourning land.



6 With pitying eye behold our need,


As thus we lift our prayer;


Correct us with Thy judgments, Lord,


Then let Thy mercy spare.



Amen.
