1. We are the Lord's: His all-sufficient merit,


Sealed on the cross to us this grace accords;


We are the Lord's, and all things shall inherit;


Whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.



2. We are the Lord's; then let us gladly tender


Our souls to Him, in deeds, not empty words;


Let heart and tongue and life combine to render


No doubtful witness that we are the Lord's.



3. We are the Lord's: no darkness brooding o'er us


Can make us tremble, whilst this star affords


A steady light along the path before us--


Faith's full assurance that we are the Lord's.



4. We are the Lord's: no evil can befall us


In the dread hour of life's fast loos'ning cords;


No pangs of death shall even then appall us;


Death we shall vanquish, for we are the Lord's.
