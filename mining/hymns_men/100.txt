1 Not what these hands have done 


Can save this guilty soul; 


Not what this toiling flesh has borne 


Can make my spirit whole.



2 Not what I feel or do 


Can give me peace with God; 


Not all my prayers and sighs and tears 


Can bear my awful load. 



3 Thy work alone, O Christ,


Can ease this weight of sin; 


Thy blood alone, O Lamb of God,


Can give me peace within.



4 Thy love to me, O God,


Not mine, O Lord, to Thee,


Can rid me of this dark unrest,


And set my spirit free.



5 Thy grace alone, O God,


To me can pardon speak;


Thy power alone, O Son of God,


Can this sore bondage break.



6 I bless the Christ of God;


I rest on love Divine;


And with unfaltering lip and heart,


I call this Saviour mine.



Amen.
