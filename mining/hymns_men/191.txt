Pour forth the oil,&#8212;pour boldly forth;


It will not fail, until


Thou failest vessels to provide


Which it may largely fill.



Make channels for the streams of love,


Where they may broadly run;


And love has overflowing streams,


To fill them every one.



But if at any time we cease


Such channels to provide,


The very founts of love for us


Will soon be parched and dried.



For we must share, if we would keep


That blessing from above;


Ceasing to give, we cease to have;&#8212;


Such is the law of love.
