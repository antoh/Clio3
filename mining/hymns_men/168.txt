From depths of woe I raise to thee

The voice of lamentation;

Lord, turn a gracious ear to me

And hear my supplication:

If thou iniquities dost mark,

Our secret sins and misdeeds dark,

O who shall stand before thee?

To wash away the crimson stain,

Grace, grace alone availeth;

Our works, alas! are all in vain;

In much the best life faileth:

No man can glory in thy sight,

All must alike confess thy might,

And live alone by mercy.

Therefore my trust is in the Lord,

And not in mine own merit;

On him my soul shall rest, his Word

Upholds my fainting spirit:

His promised mercy is my fort,

My comfort and my sweet support;

I wait for it with patience.

What though I wait the livelong night,

And till the dawn appeareth,

My heart still trusteth in his might;

It doubteth not nor feareth:

Do thus, O ye of Israel's seed,

Ye of the Spirit born indeed;

And wait till God appeareth.

Though great our sins and sore our woes

His grace much more aboundeth;

His helping love no limit knows,

Our utmost need it soundeth.

Our Shepherd good and true is he,

Who will at last his Israel free

From all their sin and sorrow.
