1 Now that the sun is gleaming bright,


Implore we, bending low,


That He, the uncreated Light


May guide us as we go.



2 No sinful word, nor deed of wrong,


Nor thoughts that idly rove,


But simple truth be on our tongue,


And in our hearts be love.



3 And while the hours in order flow,


O Christ, securely fence


Our gates, beleaguered by the foe,


The gate of every sense.



4 And grant that to Thine honour, Lord,


Our daily toil may tend;


That we begin it at Thy word,


And in Thy favor end.



Amen.
