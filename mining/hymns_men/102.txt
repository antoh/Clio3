1 O love of God, how strong and true! 


Eternal, and yet ever new; 


Uncomprehended and unbought, 


Beyond all knowledge and all thought. 



2 O love of God, how deep and great!


Far deeper than man's deepest hate;


Self-fed, self-kindled like the light,


Changeless, eternal, infinite.



3 O heavenly love, how precious still 


In days of weariness and ill, 


In nights of pain and helplessness, 


To heal, to comfort, and to bless! 



4 O wide-embracing, wondrous love! 


We read thee in the sky above,


We read thee in the earth below, 


In seas that swell, and streams that flow. 



5 We read thee best in Him who came 


To bear for us the cross of shame; 


Sent by the Father from on high, 


Our life to live, our death to die. 



6  We read thy power to bless and save,


E'en in the darkness of the grave; 


Still more in resurrection light 


We read the fullness of thy might. 



7 O love of God, our shield and stay 


Through all the perils of our way!


Eternal love, in thee we rest, 


For ever safe, for ever blest. 



Amen.
