Lord, in whose might the Saviour trod

The dark and stormy wave,

And trusted in his Father's arm,

Omnipotent to save;

When darkly round our footsteps rise

The floods and storms of life,

Send Thou Thy Spirit down to still

The dark and fearful strife.

Strong in our trust, on Thee reposed,

The ocean-path we'll dare,

Though waves around us rage and foam,

Since Thou art present there.
