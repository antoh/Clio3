1 Head of the hosts in glory!


We joyfully adore thee,


Thy Church below,


Blending with those on high--


Where through the azure sky


Thy saints in ecstasy


For ever glow!



2 Angels! archangels! glorious


Guards of the church victorious!


Worship the Lamb!


One of the Three by right--


Love, majesty, and might--


The great I AM!



3 Martyrs! whose mystic legions


March o'er yon heavenly regions


In triumph round:


Wave high your banners, wave!


Your God, our Saviour, clave


For death itself a grave,


In hell profound!



4 Saints! in fair circles, casting


Rich trophies everlasting


At Jesus' feet


Amidst our rude alarms,


We stretch forth suppliant arms,


That we, too, safe from harms,


In Heaven may meet!



5 Saviour! in glory beaming,


With radiance brightly streaming,


Enthroned in power,


Grant, by Thy awful name,


That we through flood and flame


The Gospel may proclaim,


Till life's last hour.
