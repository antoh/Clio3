Press on, press on! ye sons of light,

Untiring in your holy fight,

Still treading each temptation down,

And battling for a brighter crown.

Press on, press on! through toil and woe,

With calm resolve, to triumph go,

And make each dark and threatening ill

Yield but a higher glory still.

Press on, press on! still look in faith

To him who vanquished sin and death;

Then shall ye hear God's word, &#8220;Well done!&#8221;

True to the last, press on, press on!
