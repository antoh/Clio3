1 Jerusalem! high tower thy glorious walls!


Would God I were in thee!


Desire of thee my longing heart enthralls,


Desire at home to be:


Wide from the world outleaping,


O'er hill and vale and plain,


My soul's strong wing is sweeping,


Thy portals to attain.



2 O gladsome day, and yet more gladsome hour!


When shall that hour have come,


When my rejoicing soul its own free power


May use in going home?


Itself to Jesus giving,


In trust to His own hand,


To dwell among the living,


In that blest Fatherland.



3 A moment's time, the twinkling of an eye,


Shall be enough to soar,


In buoyant exultation, through the sky,


And reach the heavenly shore.


Elijah's chariot bringing


The homeward traveller there;


Glad troops of angels winging


It onward through the air.



4 Great fastness thou of honour! thee I greet!


Throw wide thy gracious gate,


An entrance free to give these longing feet;


At last released, though late,


From wretchedness and sinning,


And life's long, weary way;


And now, of God's gift, winning


Eternity's bright day.



5 What throng is this, what noble troop, that pours,


Arrayed in beauteous guise,


Out through the glorious city's open doors,


To greet my wondering eyes?


The hosts of Christ's elected,


The jewels that He bears


In His own crown, selected


To wipe away my tears.



6 Of prophets great, and patriarchs high, a band


That once has borne the cross,


With all the company that won that land,


By counting gain for loss,


Now float in freedom's lightness,


From tyrants' chains set free;


And shine like suns in brightness,


Arrayed to welcome me.



7 One more at last arrived they welcome there,


To beauteous Paradise,


Where sense can scarce its full fruition bear,


Or tongue for praise suffice;


Glad hallelujahs ringing


With rapturous rebound,


And rich hosannas singing


Eternity's long round.



8 Unnumbered choirs before the Lamb's high throne


There shout the jubilee,


With loud resounding peal and sweetest tone,


In blissful ecstasy:


A hundred thousand voices


Take up the wondrous song;


Eternity rejoices


God's praises to prolong.
