Slowly, by God's hand unfurled,

Down around the weary world

Falls the darkness; O, how still

Is the working of His will!

Mighty spirit, ever nigh!

Work in me as silently;

Veil the day's distracting sights,

Show me heaven's eternal lights.

Living stars to view be brought

In the boundless realms of thought;

High and infinite desires,

Flaming like those upper fires!

Holy Truth, Eternal Right,

Let them break upon my sight;

Let them shine serene and still,

And with light my being fill.
