When I put out to sea,


But such a tide as moving seems asleep,


Too full for sound and foam,

Turns again home.


Twilight and evening bell,

The flood may bear me far,


I hope to see my Pilot face to face

Again breaks forth the day new-born,


Which, rising in victorious might,


Chases away black-wandering night!


Again, my mind, in early songs


Praise Him to whom all praise belongs;


Who gave to morning dawn the light


Who gave the glittering stars to night,


Which to their Maker and their King


Around the world in chorus sing.


For o'er prolific matter, high,


Moves ether pure in fiery sky;


Where glides the moon in glorious trim,


Cutting the last encircling rim:



For to the eighth revolving stream


The star-borne courses brightly gleam.


But now beyond the starry poles


A counter sea of glory rolls,


Unbosomed; and with dance divine


Doth the Eternal Mind enshrine,


Which covered hath with hoary wings


The palace of the King of kings.


What is beyond none may relate,


Nor mind of man can penetrate:


Eternal severance restrains,


And happy silence ever reigns.


From Root, or Spring, or Fountain one


A threefold lighted Form hath shone:


For where the Father dwells above,


There dwelleth too His own heart's love,


His glorious Son, wisdom perf&#232;ct,


And of all worlds the Architect:


And in the Unity combined


The Spirit's holy Light hath shined.


One Root of Good, one Fount of Love,


Whence sprung the bliss supreme above:


And the bright holy lamps divine


In equal glory ever shine.


And thence in this fair world of ours,


With high-born intellectual powers,


A chorus now of deathless kings


The Triune glory ever sings.


And near the Fount of Love and Truth


Angelic band in changeless youth,


Guided by holy Wisdom's mind,


Immortal wreath of beauty find.


But some with dark averted eyes


Fall mindless from the lofty skies


Downward the gloomy depths among,


And bring the higher world along;


Down, down to Matter's utmost bound,


Where, settling in the depth profound,


Nature assigns them birth and place,


A God-like, though God-fallen race.



Hence giant heroes took their birth,


The mighty conquerors of earth;


And hence Breath sown o'er all the ground


Each varying type of life hath found.


But all things to Thy counsel hold,


Things past, or present, new or old:


Whate'er we have, whate'er we share,


Of all from Thee the sources are.


The Father and the Mother Thou,


Male, female, unto Thee we bow:


Or voice be heard, or all be still,


'Tis just as ordered by Thy will.


'And Thou or Nature Thyself art,


Or Nature is Thy counterpart:


And Thou art King; and ages all


Within Thine age unmeasured fall.


May I my song aright renew,


O Thou! the Root whence all things grew!


Hail! Thou, the world's Original;


Hail! Thou, the Spring, First Cause of all.


All numbers blending into one,


The Uncreated, God alone!


All hail, all hail, Thou One Divine!


All joy, all happiness be Thine!


Bend Thou, O bend propitious ear,


And this my hymn of praises bear,


Speed on true Wisdom's opening day,


Pour blessings down in rich array:


Yea, grace-distilling streams pour down,


That I may win contentment's crown


In life's sweet calm; the happy mean


Give me, riches and want between.


Off from my limbs diseases ward,


My soul from stormy passions guard:


Let no dark thoughts my steps attend:


My life from biting cares defend;


Lest, mind, borne down by earthly ill,


To soar should find nor time nor will.


But grant me with free wing to rise,


And join the chorus of the skies,


And there with Thine for ever sing


The glories of my God and King!

The Light of Life to world forlorn!



A Man! and yet of ages gone,


And of all ages yet to come,


Throughout eternity, the One


Upholder, Perfecter, and Sum.



Thyself, O Christ, art Fount of Light,


Light of the Father's Light, bright Ray!


Dark matter thou didst burst; and night


To holy souls Thou turn'st to day.



Yea! Founder of the world Thou art,


And moulder of each starry sphere:


To earth her spurs Thou dost impart;


While men hail Thee their Saviour dear.



For Thee his chariot Titan drives,


The quenchless fount of morning light.


From Thee the bull-faced moon derives


Her power to loose the gloom of night.



By Thee the year with fruit is crowned:


By Thee the flocks and herds are fed:


Productive Thou dost make the ground;


And to the poor Thou givest bread.



For Thou from Thine o'erflowing store


Of grace ineffable and love,


O'er surface of all worlds dost pour


The fertile sunshine from above.



And from Thy bosom forth did spring


To life both light, and mind, and soul:


O pity then Thine own offspring


Imprisoned under hard control,



By mortal limbs, by flesh and blood,


Coerced, and measures stern of fate:


O save Thine own, Thou great and good,


Nor let sick mind sick body hate!



Persuasion to my words nod Thou,


And to my deeds such honest fame,


That truth I never disavow,


Nor Sparta nor Cyrene shame!



But may my soul, unbowed by grief,


Draw all her nourishment from Thee,


Stretching both eyes, in calm relief,


Up to Thy light, from sorrow free!



That, cleansed from dregs of worldly soil,


I may by straight course upward mount,


And 'scaping from earth's care and toil,


Be mingled with the soul's own fount!



Life such of pure content and praise,


Do Thou to Thy poor harper grant,


While still to Thee the hymn I raise,


And glory to the Father chant,



And Spirit, mid-enthroned compeer,


The Parent Root and Branch between!


Be such on earth my bright career,


Nor sin nor sorrow intervene;



Until, within the courts above,


The travail of my soul shall cease,


Still singing hymns of heavenly love


In glory and in perfect peace.



Thee, Thee, the Fount of love, we bless,


O Father, rock and strength of Thine;


And Thee alike, His form express,


And seal, all beauty, Son Divine;



And Holy Breath, of both the crown,


Whose quickening gifts like billows roll:


Thou with the Father, send Him down


To cheer and fertilize my soul!

Now on the plain I hailed thy vestibule.

Of sacred rites I came, and mysteries divine.



V. (51-67).

And Libya's desert strand


I roamed, where neither godless spirit reigns,


Nor teeming cities' strife


Calls men to busy life;


That so my soul, from woeful toils and pains


And passions' war and groans set free,


And all the ills of fate, might harmonize with Thee.

Be still, and join in adoration to the Lord!

And whirling pool and rill,


And floods that are at rivers' mouths forth hurled;

And sacrifice of praise in upward strains is sent.

Nor let their craft prevail!

Against God's praying people, His true Israel!

In theme divine, and miss the rightful ordered way.



XI. (118-125).

When Thy dread beacons blaze?


What eye so wise, so strong, of mortal man,

Thence pluck fair flowers of light,


Nor leave to thankless winds an offering:

And from eternity the Root whence all things grow.

Thou art the Eternal Root,


Thou art the spreading Shoot!

But here and there a word outpours,


While feebly it the unfathomed depth around explores.

Thou art the Parent Tree,


All have their life from Thee,


Or stem or branch, whatever is, is Thine.

The Father and the Son Thy Light doth intervene.

All reverence to Thee,


Eternal Spirit, be!


Thou of the Three the middle rank dost hold.


And now, most glorious Son,


Thy praises be begun!


Thy birth, thy generation, is untold:


The Father's Son, the Father's Will,


With Him Thou present wast, and present Thou art still.



XXV. (241-253)


Thou with the Father art,


And ever next His heart;


Nor can deep flowing Time Thy birth reveal;


Nor aged Aeon say


When was Thy natal day;


He never learned, nor could remove the seal.


Son with the Father! He the same


Who should hereafter give to Aeon birth and name.



XXVI. (254-265).


32


Who hath adjudged the eye


Into God's depths to pry?


The subtle tongue will dare, but man is blind.


Such daring is in vain,

Thou dost to Thine pour light upon the mind,


And guard their hearts with holy care,


That they in darkness sink not through gross matter's snare.



XXVII. (266-275).


To Thee all holy praise


It well befits to raise;


For Thou of all art Father, all are Thine:


Thou all the worlds didst found,


Thou dost all ages bound,


Thou framedst all the host of heaven divine;


To Thee all minds of light do sing,


And starry spheres intelligent hail thee their King!



XXVIII. (276-285).

While round in holy choir


Dance their bright orbs of fire,


The blest ones all do shout and sing before Thee;


The world within, around,


They all Thy praise resound,


All in their stations evermore adore Thee:


Those in the zones; and those outside,


Who yet their several posts assigned in wisdom guide.



XXIX. (286-300).


These come to guard, or tame,


Earth's helmsmen, sons of fame;


Of link angelic, and who draw their birth


From old heroic race;


Who ever take their place,


By hidden ways, o'er men and things of earth:


And though of an unyielding will,


To dark-rayed worldly glories ever yield they still.



XXX. (301-311).


34


To Thee blithe nature sings,


And all from her that springs:


For Thou with heavenly breath dost them renew,


Forth pouring from above


Thy stores of grace and love,


Which ever fresh descend in showers and dew;


Thou to all nature nature art,


O Lord of worlds unstained! and dost Thine own impart.



XXXI. (312-319).


For nature Thou didst train


And school, that she again


Might parent be of every mortal thing;


The faithful counterpart


Of all that Thyself art,


Of life and health the everflowing spring!


That to the world's extremest bound


Each part in turn with living beauty might be crowned.



XXXII. (320-328).


35


For it were never right


That things should jar and fight,


Or dregs of earth with excellence contend;


But all by Thy decree


Is wrought in harmony;


Nor aught shall perish, nor the chorus end;


But each from other takes its share,


And all through one another taste Thy loving care.



XXXIII. (329-334).


The eternal wheel revolves,


And the dark riddle solves;


Things die; Thou sendest forth Thy breath, they live,


And in fresh glory bloom,


Renewed from mortal doom.


Thus nurtured nature nurturing doth give;


And she doth sing a deathless song


To Thee by all her children through the ages long.



XXXIV. (335-342).


36


In colour or in skin,


Without, or life within,


And deeds, however varied they may be,


Yet nature moulds them all


Obedient to her call;


And links them fast in holy unity;


And from all creatures thus doth raise


Of differing voices one harmonious hymn of praise.



XXXV. (343-357).


To Thee, their Lord and King,


All things their tribute bring


Of ceaseless praise; the night, the morn, the sky,


The lightning flash, the snow,


And things that spring and grow;


All bodies and all spirits; birds that fly,


And beasts that graze; seeds, plants, and roots;


The sea with all that swims, and earth with all her fruits.



XXXVI. (358-367).


37


The waves of trouble roll;


Look Thou upon my soul,


To act so powerless, to learn so slow,


Where on Thy Libyan sands


The mystic temple stands;


For hither I, Thy holy will to know,


Oppressed with grief, my steps have bent,


On prayer and supplication unto Thee intent.



XXXVII. (368-374).


Before Thy favouring eye


Earth's gloomy vapours fly:


Look Thou on me, and bid my sorrows cease.


'Tis so! e'en now my heart


Through food Thy hymns impart--


For Thine they are--hath nourishment of peace,


And points my mind with keen desire


To rise afresh to thoughts and words of heavenly fire.



XXXVIII. (375-380).


38


But send, O King, Thy light,


To quicken my dull sight,


And guide me on the road that leads to Thee.


And, Father, grant, I pray,


That from the body's sway


My better part, escaping, may be free,


And not again be downward hurled


Beneath the floods and eddies of this troubled world.



XXXIX. (381-391).


Yet here, while in the strife


Of world-enchain&#232;d life,


O Bless&#232;d, may kind fortune smile on me;


Nor stormy tempest blow


To check the holy glow,


Or rudely break the mind's tranquillity;


Lest inrush of the worldly flood


Should leave to me no leisure for the things of God.



XL. (392-400).


39


And whereto I have striven,


By grace which Thou hast given,


(For all good gifts of help and strength are Thine),


May I the ground retain,


Nor e'er fall back again.


For which Thy gifts this humble wreath of mine


From holy fields to Thee I bring,


O Thou of all creations pure the Eternal King;



XLI. (402-409).


To Thee and to Thy Son,


Thine own, the only One,


Alone of Thee begotten, the All-wise,


Whom from eternity


Thou hadst, and hast, with Thee,


Though forth from Thee He came to harmonize


All things, and fashion, form, and guide,


By wisdom's breath outpoured, and over all preside.



XLII. (410-416).


40


The hoary ages wake,


And their due course take,


At his command; and of His matchless skill,


And workmanship divine,


As if by plumb and line,


This rugged world He mouldeth to His will,


Whate'er exists above the ground,


Or on its surface, or within its depths profound.



XLIII. (417-427).


And merciful and kind


He shines with holy mind


On toiling mortals; and doth bring relief;


For He doth loose the chain


Of toilsome care and pain;


Effects their good, and drives away their grief.


The God who did the world create,


What marvel that His own He guard from whelming fate?



XLIV. (428-440).


41


And hither southward now,


That I might pay this vow


To Thee the mighty world's eternal guide,


I came from northern Thrace,


Where three years' dreary space


Near the Imperial Court I did abide,


In toil, with tears and anguish sore,


For on my shoulders I my mother country bore,



XLV. (441-454).


And well Thou know'st, good Lord,


How from my limbs was poured


A sweat of agony from day to day:


Nor rest had I by night


In that dire mental fight:


But watered was the couch on which I lay


From streaming eyes. Then to and fro,


To every shrine a suppliant I made haste to go.



XLVI. (455-462).


42


To all in turn I bring


Prayer, chaplet, offering,


And water with my tears each sacred floor,


That I might not with pain


Have journey made in vain,


But that Thou wouldst wide-open hopeful door.


Thus in my own and country's need


I with Thy holy ones through fruitful Thrace did plead;



XLVII. (463-473).


And who across the main,


Guard Carthaginian plain,


I sought them all, if they might succour me,


Throughout the region round,


Whom Thou with rays hadst crowned


Angelic, Thine attendant saints to be.


The blest ones helped my eager prayers,


They helped my many toils, and soothed my many cares.



XLVIII. (474-489).


43


Life did no pleasure yield,


While my poor country reeled


Half stunned: but Thou hast righted her, O King!


The Rock of Ages Thou,


To whom the world doth bow!


Crushed were my limbs, my soul a lifeless thing:


But Thou from Heaven hast breathed at length


New vigour on my soul, and on my limbs new strength.



XLIX. (490-497).


For Thou hast-brought relief,


And stayed o'erflowing grief:


Toils have an end, the wearied soul hath rest.


'Twas by Thy wisdom planned,


'Twas wrought out by Thy hand.


Thou to my mind hast given refreshment blest.


Now, O my God, do Thou ordain,


That to the Libyans these Thine own sweet gifts remain;



L. (498-505).


44


Of our long tribulation,


Of Thy so great Salvation,


A lasting record! Hear Thy suppliant's prayer;


And henceforth may my life


Be safe from harmful strife.


Loose me from toil, disease, and deadly care.


Thus to Thy servant bow Thine ear,


And grant my mental life be ever bright and clear.



LI. (506-523).


I would not showers of wealth


To try the soul's best health,


And leave no leisure for the things divine;


Nor poverty would I,


With downcast sullen eye,


Black spectre to the house, prone to repine,


Bowed down to earth with earthly cares.


Both grovel on the ground, and both are dangerous snares.



LII. (524-532).


45


And both forgetful are


Of better things by far,


The mind, and all that to the mind doth cling,


Unless, O heavenly Friend,


Thou shouldst Thy help extend.


Yea, Father, wisdom's holy self and spring,


Upon this faltering soul of mine


The light of mind from Thine own bosom cause to shine.



LIII. (533-543).


And on my heart, I pray,


Turn Thou blest wisdom's ray,


With helping hand, and point the holy road


That leadeth unto Thee;


And set Thy seal on me,


And let me have the token of my God;


And from my life, and from my prayer,


Drive earthly demons of presumption and despair.



LIV. (544-553).


46


And may my body be


From all dishonour free,


As fortress unassailable to foe;


And may my spirit pure


Unto the end endure


By Thine all-saving help. Full well I know,


That I do bear dark worldly stain,


And held in bondage am by earthly passions' chain;



LV. (544-563).


But Thou deliverer art,


And cleanser of the heart.


From evils circling round escape afford,


And from diseases all,


And bonds that fret and gall.


I bear Thy seed, of noble mind, good Lord,


A spark that issued forth from Thee,


And flashing down through depths of matter lit on me.



LVI. (564-574).


47


For in the world, O King,


Thou mad'st a soul to spring,


And in the body, through the soul, a mind:


O pity then Thine own,


The handmaid from Thy throne:


From Thee descending, hapless I did bind


Myself as labourer free to earth:


Not labourer now, but slave, downfallen from my birth.



LVII. (575-585).


For, me the world around


With witchery hath bound,


Some little strength may yet remain in me


Of secret inner light,


Not yet extinguished quite:


But o'er my head is rolled a mighty sea,


That doth make blind the mental eye


That would its God and things of heavenly worth descry.



LVIII. (586-592).


48


O look with pitying eye,


And hear the mournful cry


Of Thine own child, O Father good and kind:


Whom oft when she would rise


Up to her native skies,


Impelled by holy efforts of the mind,


Yet fascination of this world


Hath choked, and back to earth's dark mazes hurled.



LIX. (593-602).


But O! send forth Thy light,


A beacon fire through night,


To guide' and cheer me on my upward way;


And may that seed take root,


And, striking out its shoot


From small beginning, bead of flower display.


O Father, such Thy help divine,


Enthrone me in the light of life above to shine;



LX. (603-611).


49


Where nature cannot clasp


With her resistless grasp:


And whence no longer earth, or web of fate,


Can back recall to woe


And vain desires below.


Let brood deceitful that I scorn and hate


Of worldly passions scattered be,


And leave thy servant, O my God, at peace with Thee!



LXI. (612-627).


Me and earth's din betwixt


Be fiery barrier fixed.


Thy grace, O Father, to my soul reveal;


And let thy suppliant find,


With outspread wings of mind,


The ascending path, and bear aloft Thy seal,


A terror to the up-springing foe,


Who breathe to mortals godless thoughts from depths below;



LXII. (628-635).


50


But badge and token known


To those about Thy throne,


The holy ones, who all the heights survey


Of Thy bright world, and stand


As guards in high command,


Bearing the keys of upward fiery way,


That they may give an entrance free,


And open wide the gates of heavenly light to me.



LXIII. (636-645),


But still while creeping here


Upon this empty sphere


Of earth, yet not of earth grant me to be;


But from a better root


E'en here attesting fruit


To bear of fire-proved deeds, my God, to Thee;


And Thy true voice to hear and know,


And whate'er warms and makes in souls blest hope to grow.



LXIV. (646-653).


51


It doth me now repent


Of life on earth ill-spent:


Begone, the blear-eyed haze of godless men,


And built-up cities' strength


Begone, ye breadth and length


Of worldly aims, nor harass me again,


Ye sweet calamities, ye toys


Of mighty seeming, bootless boons, and joyless joys.



LXV. (654-661).


Tranced by your bravery


The soul in slavery


To earth is held; and wretched is indeed;


For of her own good things


This cup oblivion brings:


And things, wherewith to satisfy her need


She hoped, are forthwith snatched away;


And from vain dream she wakes to envy's shaft a prey.



LXVI. (662-670).


52


For fortune here below


A double face doth show,


False queen: whom if you haply win and trust,


And in her livery shine,


And at her table dine,


Soon rue your lot with bitter tears you must,


When down from pedestal so high


You fall in widespread ruin, and neglected lie.



LXVII. (672-683).


For here, from adverse sides,


Now good, now ill, betides:


To mortals such is life's necessity.


To God, or what hath birth


From God, but not to earth,


Is good unmingled with adversity.


Did cup of sweets intoxicate?


Ensnared I learnt by crop of woes a lesson late.



LXVIII. (684-693).


53


I hate these laws of change


And hence now upward range,


With wings expanded, to the peaceful sky:


To bright ethereal plains,


Where my dear Father reigns,


From earth, and earths two-sided gifts I fly.


O Steward of the life of mind,


To Thee I look; with Thee may I acceptance find.



LXIX. (694-703).


My soul doth hang on Thee:


Heed Thou Thy suppliant's plea,


Bound here on earth, yet struggling to ascend


The upward paths of mind:


As Thou thus far hast shined,


O shine yet more: light wings of succour lend


Snap double passions' bond, and chain


Of earth unloose, and let my soul her freedom gain.



LXX. (704-713).


54


For nature by these chains


Her treacherous power obtains,


And binds me down to earth a helpless prey;


But from the body freed,


And all its direful need,


Grant me to take swift flight to realms of day,


To Thine own halls and Thine own breast,


Whence flows the Fountain of the soul; and be at rest.



LXXI. (714-725).


A drop from Fountain Head


Poured, forth, to earth I sped,


An exile and a wanderer from Thee;


Me now, I pray, restore


To where I was before:


With light ancestral may I mingled be!


Tune Thou my mind with Thine own choir


In holiness to sing the hymns Thou dost inspire.



LXXII. (726-734).


55


Once saved from mortal plight,


Once mingled with the light,


O Father, grant I never enter more


Within earth's black domains


Of penalties and pains;


But while I yet am chained to this dark shore,


And bear life's drudgery below,


Bid Thou that fortune's breezes on me gently blow.

And on the ripeness of mine age

Of harvest rich from well-sown seed.


And on that darling son of mine


May Thy preserving mercy shine,


Whom, when just passing gate of death,


Thou didst restore to vital breath.


O Lord of life, 'twas Thou didst wrench


From Death's firm grasp, his prey, and quench


My burning grief in floods of joy;


For Thou didst give me back my boy;


And tears, O Father, Thou didst dry,


In answer to Thy suppliant's cry!


May son and daughter, much loved pair,


Thy kind protection ever share,


And all my house, in happy calm,


Be sheltered by Thine hand from harm!


And, O my Saviour King, bless Thou

From sickness and from sorrow free,


Faithful, one-minded, may she be,


Preserved by Thee from thought of sin,


All bright without, all pure within!


Untouched by roving passions' tide,


My honoured wife, my love, my pride!


Loose Thou my soul from baneful chains


Of worldly life, its cares and pains,


And floods of dismal grief and woe,


Which overwhelm this earth below.


O! thus prepared may I be found


With holy worshippers around


To lead the choir, and chants to raise


To Thy all-glorious Father's praise;


And to Thy majesty, great King,


Loud hymns again I hope to sing;


Again in voice of praise Thy name


To bless, Thy honours to proclaim;


May be, my harp I shall again


Tune all-unhurt to highest strain.

And poured forth is the night,

I sing, O Healer of the soul,

II. (10-17).



And wisdom's spring Thou art,


And dost of it impart;

Untroubled life to live,

Let air be silent too: and rapid streams

Who haunt recesses dark, and in the tombs remain;

Befriend, and upward these my hymns and prayers convey!

The One, the only One,


The Father Thou alone,


The One beginning whence all else began;


The Fount whence all founts flow,


The Root whence all roots grow;


The Good whence good in all its channels ran;


The Star that to all stars gave birth;


The World whence sprang all worlds from highest heaven to earth.



VIII. (68-79).



The Form of all forms known:


All beauty is Thine own:


The hidden Seed, the ages' Parent Prop:


Of worlds intelligent


The Father, whence forth sent


Ambrosial Breath, and floating drop by drop


Upon embodied bulk, combines


A second world, which in reflected glory shines.



IX. (80-88).


O Bless&#232;d, Thee I praise,


Or whether voice I raise,


Or solemn silence keep; for to Thine ear


Not more the uttered speech


Than Mind's still voice doth reach:


Unuttered though the word, yet Thou dost hear.


With Thee I praise the First-born One,


The First-sprung Light, Thine own Begotten only Son.

Thou Lord of power and might,


Light of the Father light,


Of the Ineffable the glorious Word;

I hymn in unity;

Forth from the Father and through Thee, with Thee I sing.

True counsel He unfolds


And middle rule He holds:


Breath holy! Spur of Father, Spur of Son!

Upon the Son: through whom forth springs the Spirit Lord.

And seventh in the dance of stars unwearied rolls.

The many lights on high


One surface beautify


In Thy great world: for Thou dost so ordain:

All in this globe Thou dost survey,


And all in circuit tend; and all Thy laws obey.



XVII. (171-180).


And in the depths of sky


Unfathomed we descry


Thy ruling hand and power; for it is there


That Thou the stars dost lead,

Thou dost their tasks assign, and life on all bestow.

Whoe'er have quaffed of mind,

And nature's unrestrained control


For hangs on Thee the growth of even eyeless soul.



XIX. (193-212).


And things that lack Thy breath


Are yet upheld from death;


For Thou hast linked them to the One Supreme:


Whence flows to earth by Thee


Life's channel still kept free


Through trackless worlds; and the descending stream


Of good doth mould this world of ours


To form of unseen world of highest mental powers.



XX. (213-226).



A second sun hath shone


This lower world upon:


Parent of later light: and bright-eyed lord


Of what doth live to-day,

All world-born good, by Thy decree;


And is, O Thou God-born, type visible of Thee.

Beyond mind's utmost reach,


Beyond all power of speech,


Ineffable, unknown, O Father dread!


Thou art of mind the Mind,


Of souls the Soul combined,


Of natures all Thou art the Fountain-head.


Behold! Thy servant bends the knee,


And down on earth a poor blind suppliant falls to Thee.



XXII. (238-250).



But Thou the light dost give,


The light for mind to live;


To suppliant soul, O Bless'd, pity show:


Diseases chase away,


And cares the soul which slay,


And shameless earthly dog, and fiendish foe:


Far from my soul and from my prayer,


Far from my life and deeds, chase every hurtful snare.



XXIII. (252-259).


Armed may my body be


Against the enemy,


And armed my spirit, and whate'er is mine;


Nor may he entrance find


Within my heart or mind.


Out be he cast, and out, by help Divine,


Remain, and leave me, and take flight,


The worldly fiend, who gives to passions strength and might.



XXIV. (260-274).



And who obstructs the road


Which upward leads to God;


And quencheth aspiration's holy flame.


But, O great King, give me,


Companion meet to be,


An angel of Thine own, of holy name,


Of holy aid, an angel friend,


Who may God-lighted prayer, and all good deeds defend.



XXV. (275-280).


A guardian may he be


Of soul and life to me,


And to my prayer and deeds protection yield;


My body may he save


From trouble's rushing wave,


And sickness; and from harm my spirit shield,


And o'er my soul oblivion pour


Of earthly passions which disturbed my peace before.



XXVI. (281-290).



So may I spend my life


All calm and free from strife!


So may my soul, in hymning Thy high praise,


Mount up with strengthened wing


From earth, and heavenward spring!


So may I cleanse from worldliness my ways,


Till I, set free from earth-bound chain,


No longer subject am to Fate's imperious reign;



XXVII. (291-299).


But gain those halls above,


And Thy blest folds of love,


Whence forth doth flow the fountain of the soul!


But Thou propitious be,


And helping hand give me!


Call me, O Bless&#232;d! all my ways control!


Hear Thou Thy humble suppliant's cry,


And lift my soul from earth to native realms on high!

To Thee I raise the hymn anew,


Who didst the serpent's wiles subdue,

That filled e'en Paradise with woe:

Of woeful knowledge nurse and root,


Our primal founder he o'ercame,


And smote the world with death and shame.


All-glorious Thou with many a crown!


Thou didst to wretched earth come down,


To dwell with man by death assailed,


Thyself in mortal body veiled;


And Thou dark Tartarus didst tread,


Midst countless nations of the dead,


Then Hades, ancient-born, amazed,


Did shudder as on Thee he gazed;


And the all-devouring savage hound


Backward recoiled with frightened bound.


But lo! to holy souls, oppressed


With direful woes, Thou gavest rest,


That they in chorus led by Thee,


To praise the Father might be free.


And from below when Thou didst rise,


The demon-hosts beneath the skies,


Unnumbered, quaked, O mighty King,


To hear the judgment Thou shouldst bring.


Then did the stars, immortal band,


Gazing at Thee, astonished stand.


But Ether laughed, the father he--


The father wise--of harmony;


And mingled from his seven-toned lyre


Bright notes of music's holy fire,


Raising to Lord of earth and sky,


The song of victory on high.


And Lucifer, the guide of day,


With smiling countenance was gay;


And golden Hesperus afar


Shot beams, the Cythere&#239;an star.


And shepherdess of right, the Moon


Filled her bright crescent with festoon,


And flowering wreath of liquid fire,


And led her peers in joyous choir.


And through the trackless paths of air


Titan spread out his flaming hair:


For God's own Son, the master Mind


Which did all things create and bind


In mutual law, full well he knew,


From whom his primal fire he drew.


But Thou, as plying heavenly oar,


Or wing of bird, didst upward soar


With holy feet; and o'er the skies


And dark-blue-vaulted heaven didst rise,


Up-mounting to the spheres of light,


The realms of Mind for ever bright.


There goodness from the Fountain-head


In bliss through silent heaven is spread;


There nor deep-flowing restless Time


Drags earthborn children through the slime


Of coarser matter, nor hard fates


Roll turbid floods o'er mortal states;


But Age himself, the ancient-sprung,


Is ageless, old at once, and young;


And in the unfading courts of love


is steward to the blest above.

Harbour dark thoughts of selfish greed.



Hark! 'tis the sweet cicada's song:


He drinks the dew, and chirps along.


And, lo! my strings unbidden sound,


And here and there a voice around!


What in the world--what melody


Will pang divine bring forth to me?



'Tis so! Self-sprung Beginning He,


50Father and Lord of all that be:


Not made, not born, on high alone


He hath o'er lofty heaven His throne.


There glory changeless He displays,


And sceptre there eternal sways;


Of unities pure Unity,


And Sole of sole existence He!


High ether pure He did combine,


And quicken into Life Divine.



He then, ere yet the ages ran,


In mode ineffable to man, 


The Godhead through the Firstborn poured:


Hence Three, yet One, the Triune Lord.



And now the heavenly fount around


Behold, with children's beauty crowned,


Forth from the centre as they spring,


Or round it flow in joyous ring.



But stop, rash lyre, thy lofty flight,


Nor touch things hid from mortal sight!


To men below it is not given


To tell high mystic rites of heaven.


The things beneath do thou reveal;


The things above let silence seal.



But Mind now cares for worlds alone,


In which reflected mind is shown:


A good beginning this we sing,


For thence man's spirit hath its spring:


For now to matter came there down


Mind incorruptible, high crown,


Severed in each, and fragment small,


Yet true descent from God of all.


This whole, in every part one-centred,


Whole into whole as it hath entered,


Takes station at the eternal poles,


And heaven's resplendent circle rolls.


Divided next, to those again,


In given form who yet retain


Their dowry unimpaired of mind,


There are high offices assigned;


The chariot race of stars one guides,


One o'er the angelic choir presides.


But, ah! another, empty, vain,


Self-dragged by down-inclining chain,


Hath found a form of lower earth,


Deep fallen from his heavenly birth:


From home apostate far he flew,


And cups of Lethe's darkness drew;


Of eyeless soul and murky mind,


To heaven's true joy and glory blind;


Fain he to joyless earth repaired,


A god by mortal things ensnared.


All dark! yet, lo! to mortal eyes


A ray of cheering light doth rise!


A door of hope is opened high,


And helping hand is stretched out nigh,


To lift the fallen here on earth


Back to the honours of their birth,


When they, emerging from the strife


And din and cares of storm-tossed life,


To holy paths have turned indeed,


Which to their Father's palace lead.


Blest he who from the entangling mesh


Of matter and of greedy flesh


Hath fled, and on with springing bound


The upward way to God hath found!


Blest he who, after fates severe,


And toils and many a bitter tear,


And all the crowd of anxious cares


Which earth to all her votaries shares,


To mind's true course at length restored,


Hath God's own shining depth explored!



A task it is, to lift above


Whole outstretched soul in new-born love


Yet only make determined start,


With wings of mind and honest heart,


And nigh to thee will He appear


With stretched-forth hands, thy Father dear.


Before will run a shining light,


And all thy upward paths make bright:


Fields of sweet thought thou now shalt tread,


Pledge of true beauty, for thee spread!


Come, O my soul, and drink of this,


A fountain flowing with all bliss;


And to thy Father, lifting prayer,


Without delay, up-mount the air.


Leaving to earth the things of earth,


In God assert thy godlike birth;


And mingling with thy Father, Friend,


Taste joys above that never end.

The Bridegroom cometh! overhead


The shout descending wakes the dead!


Go forth to meet the King,


The gates just entering!


Virgins, white-robed, with lamps haste eastward forth to meet Him,


Haste ye, O haste to greet Him!



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



2.


Earth's mournful bliss I left, and toys


Of wanton life, and foolish joys:


To Thee alone I cling:


Thou art my Life, my King:


Grant that I may, O Bless&#232;d, ever close to Thee,


Thy royal beauty see!



THE REFRAIN.

Thou art my wealth: for Thee I fled


All worldly lure; and upward sped;


And come in spotless dress


Of Thine own Righteousness,


With Thee to enter in the bridal chamber gates,


Where perfect bliss awaits.



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



4.


Saved from the dragon's myriad wiles,


By which the simple he beguiles,


I bore the dreadful fire,


And wild beasts' savage ire;


Waiting till Thou from Heaven, O Hope of all creation,


shouldst come to my salvation!



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



My home and country for Thy sake,


And maiden dance, I did forsake,


And mother's pride and race,


And thoughts of rank and place;


For Thou, O Christ the Word, art all in all to me:


I long for naught save Thee!



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



6.


Hail! Christ the Life, unchanging Day,


Accept this humble virgin lay:


To Thee our song of praise


With heart and voice we raise!


In Thee, O Thou perfection's flower, O Word Divine,


Love, joy, mind, wisdom, shine.



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



O Bride, triumphant now in light,


And clad in robes of purest white,


Sweet-breathing, sinless, free,


Ope wide the gates to me:


Sit we in self-same company near Christ above,


And sing thy marriage, Love!



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



8.


Ah me! some virgins vainly pour


Their sobs and cries outside the door:


Their lamps are quenched, and they


No burning light display:


Their error they would mend: but ah! they come too late,


And clos&#232;d is the gate.



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



For they a foolish part had played,


And from the sacred pathway strayed;


Oil, they had purchased none:


Ah! wretched and undone!


Forbidden with dead lamps the home of bliss to see,


They wail their misery.



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



10.


Lo! goblet filled with sweetest wine:


Drink we, O virgins, 'tis Divine;


And forth-set for our need:


Lo! this is drink indeed;


This for the guests, who to the marriage bidden are,


The Bridegroom doth prepare.



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



First type, O Bless&#232;d One, of Thee


In Abel shining bright we see:


To heaven he lifts his eyes,


Blood-dripping, and thus cries:


'Me, by my cruel brother slain, receive, O Lord,


O Thou the Eternal Word.'



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



12.


Joseph, another type of Thee,


Won highest prize of purity:


Whom Thou wouldst own Thy child:


He scorned to be beguiled


By, shameless woman; stripped, he yet her wrath defied,


And straight to Thee he cried:



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



A lamb for sacrifice is sought:


A lamb-like victim Jephthah brought:


For rash-made vow he cared,


Nor virgin daughter spared:


A type, O Bless&#232;d One, of Thy humanity,


She poured her soul to Thee:



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



14.


In valour Judith holds high post:


The leader of the oppressing host


She smote by beauty's lure,


Herself a type all pure:


He headless lay; and unto Thee the conquering maid


Her love in song displayed:



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



The Judges twain, by passion's flame


Enkindled, and all dead to shame,


Would chaste Susannah bind


To their unhallowed mind:


To their proposals base she gave a just reply:


And raised her voice on high:



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



16.


'Twere better far that I should die,


Than traitress be to marriage tie,


And yielding to your will


Both soul and body kill:


Base men! God's fire of wrath eternal would me seize:


Save me, O Christ, from these!



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



And he who thousands washed from sin,


Of Thy true light the bringer-in,


For virtue's cause alone


Is into prison thrown


By wicked king: and staining now the ground with gore,


He cried to Thee the more:



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



18.


And Thy blest Mother, spotless maid,


Was thought her vows to have betrayed,


When travailing with Thee,


O Lord of purity:


And found with child of transcendental heavenly birth,


She raised her voice from earth:



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



Thy saints, all eager that they may


Behold the glories of the day


Of Thine espousals high,


With holy gifts draw nigh:


For Thou, O Word, hast called them, Thou the angels' King:


White-robed to Thee they sing.



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



20.


O holy Church, O heavenly Bride,


With hymns, attending at Thy side,


We yet on earth below


Thine honour thus forth-show:


All snow-white thou, all beauteous spouse of Christ above,


All purity, all love.



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



Past are corruption, sickness, pain;


Nor tears shall ever flow again;


For troubles all have fled;


And death himself is dead:


And sin and folly with dark dismal train are gone,


Since grace in glory shone.



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



22.


No longer Paradise of men


Is void; for there God wills again


That man should safely dwell;


Yea, man the same who fell


Beneath the serpent's wiles: now in the promised rest,


Immortal, fearless, blest.



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



Thou now to heavenly places raised,


By all the virgin choir art praised,


O Bride of Heavenly King:


And song all new we sing:


With lighted torch in hand, with snow-white lilies crowned,


Thy praise in Christ we sound.



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.



24.


153


Father of heaven, supreme in might,


Dwelling in pure eternal light


With Thine own Son most dear,


Admit--for we are here--


E'en us within the gates of life, to sing Thy love


In Thy blest courts above.



THE REFRAIN.


With holy feet, and lamps bright burning,


I go to meet my Lord returning.

Thou Light of the Eternal Light,

2.


Thou dost the Spirit give,


Third Light, in glory one;


His grace, by whom alone we live,


Thou dost refuse to none.



3.


Thou didst the darkness scatter,


Thou mad'st the light to shine,


That now through all primeval matter

4.


It, a rude mass before,


From Thee took order new;


And shapely form, and steadfast law,


So beautiful to view.



5.


And mind of man with light


From heaven Thou didst endow,

6.


And lighted in his soul,

And thenceforth not in part, but whole,

O Thou, the One Supreme o'er all!


For by what other name


May we upon Thy greatness call,


Or celebrate Thy fame?



2


Ineffable! to Thee what speech


Can hymns of honour raise?


Ineffable! what tongue can reach


The measure of Thy praise?



3.



How, unapproached, shall mind of man


Descry Thy dazzling throne;


And pierce, and find Thee out, and scan,


Where Thou dost dwell alone?



4.


Unuttered Thou! all uttered things


Have had their birth from Thee:


The One unknown! from Thee the springs


Of all we know and see!



5.


Mindful, and mindless, all things yield


To Thy parental sway


For Thou to all art life and shield:


They honour and obey.



6.


For round Thee centre all the woes


Of night and darkling day,


The common wants and common throes;


And all to Thee do pray.

And all things as they move along


In order fixed by Thee,


Thy watchword heed, in silent song


Hymning Thy majesty.

And lo! all things abide in Thee,


And through the complex whole,


Thou spread'st Thine own Divinity,


Thyself of all the goal.

How call Thee as we ought?


Thou art unlimited, alone,


Beyond the range of thought.

Bright tokens of Thy love!

O Thou the One Supreme o'er all!

Thy Bridegroom glorify!


Always thyself keep pure,


In word and wisdom sure,


That bright with Him all-bright


Thou e'er mayst dwell in light.


Far better spouse is He


Than earthly spouse could be:


Thy union happier far


Than mortal unions are.



In bodily estate


Thou yet didst imitate


The intellectual powers,


Giving to Him thy hours:


And didst acquire on earth


The angels' right of birth.


'Tis 'bind and loose' below,


Bodies from bodies grow:


Above each stands alone,


Nor loosing there is known.



Of pure existence, they


First bear the ethereal ray,


Spirit and fire: none rests,


Doing great God's behests.


But now wild matter found--


All nature flowing round


With unresisted force--


A mingled intercourse;


But God the flood restrained,


And marriage laws ordained.



But thou hast hence escaped,


And upward thy course shaped;


From matter's base alloy


To spirit's holy joy.


Mind harmonized with mind,


Doth truest pleasure find:


Such harmony is thine,


A harmony divine.


With flesh thou war dost wage,


And helpest God's image:



For thou art God's own breath,


With body yoked till death:


That out of wrestling sore,


At length the battle o'er,


And earth well beaten down,


Thou mayst receive the crown.


To marriage also raise,


But only second praise.


That is for passion given,


This is bright light of heaven:



That founds a pure offspring,


This is self-offering.


This honoured was, we hold,


At seasons marked of old.


To this in Paradise


Lo! Adam testifies:


For this on Sinai's peak


Doth Moses also speak;


128


And Zachary the priest,


Of God's true saints not least,



And whom we hail the rather


As the Forerunner's father.


But marriage hath its need:


Hence springs a holy seed:


And hence the virgin bride,


Honoured at God's own side.


Yet of the flesh it is, and earth,


All earthly from its birth.


When law and shadows ruled,


And we were sometime schooled,



Marriage held sceptre mild,


Yet like a little child.


But when the letter died,


The Spirit was supplied:


For Christ had come and borne


In flesh our woes and scorn:


Had brought Redemption nigh,


And then ascended high:


Christ, sprung from Virgin's womb,


Christ, Conqueror o'er the tomb.


Then continence did rise,


And this base world despise,


Which should its course have mended,


And high with Christ ascended.



Thou journey'st well! but haste!


Behind is fiery waste:


Take to thy steps good heed,


And to the mountain speed.


Cast not one backward glance


On Sodom, lest perchance



Thou, fixed upon the ground,


A pile of salt be found.


In battling with the flesh


Take ever courage fresh,


Neither by terror bent,


Nor over-confident.


Faint not, for He is nigh


Who will all strength supply.



A spark may kindle hell:


Water the flame cloth quell.


Full means to thee are lent


For good self-government.


Let thou the fear of God


Freeze the rebellious blood:


Fasting the flesh control:


Keep watches o'er thy soul,


And pour it forth in prayer:


Such thy true weapons are.


Add tears: and lowly bed,


With reeds or rushes spread:



One constant flame of love


Rising to God above,


And lulling all desire


Which doth not up aspire.


The fallen rise by thee!


The shipwrecked pitied be!


Thyself live out the gale,


Expanding Hope's bright sail.



They fall not who ne'er rise,


But they who try the skies.


Few mount on pinion wings:


Straight course to humbler things.


Fell Lucifer through pride


Angels in heaven reside.


One, traitor, sunk in night:


The eleven are stars of light.



Be pure, be wholly pure,


Of this make ever sure,


Lest thou, by heeding not,


Christ's spotless robe shouldst spot.


Let modest be thine eye:


Thy tongue speak maidenly:


Thy mind not pandering,


Thy foot not wandering:


Nor loud laugh marking thee,


As one we blush to see.



Thy poor and tarnished wear,


Thy unadorn&#232;d hair,


I bonour more than pearls,


Or silken dress, or curls.



Fair flower is modest face,


And paleness is true grace:


And virtues plentiful


Are braid most beautiful.


With paints let others dress


The living God's likeness;


Live tablet they of sin,


And all that's base within.


Whate'er thou hast of beauty,


Die let it all to duty: 


But beauty of the soul--


'Tis God's--it keep thou whole.



Of men, though good they be,


The sight 'twere best thou flee.


Some cheat might thee entrance,


Or be entranced perchance:


Eye now with eye bespangling,


And word with word entangling,


Then cheek with cheek o'erglowing,


And mutual passion flowing.


'Tis well: but not for thee:


Not thine the accursed tree:


The tree of Life thy care;


The serpent's guile beware!



O maiden, hear my word,


Have thou no other lord;


Thy Bridegroom reigns above


And bids thee faithful prove.


133


Thou from the flesh hast fled,


And it to thee is dead,


Why turn to it again,


And make thy work all vain?


That singleness of thine


Is a rare gift divine:


Few they whom it adorns,


As rose among the thorns.


Such grace'tis thine to know:


High o'er the snares below,


By which the wicked fall,


Thou safely passest all.



Lo! one no sooner builds,


And bridal chamber gilds,


Than she with mournful gloom


Forth bears him to the tomb.


Felt one a father's pride?


At once the loved child died.


And oh! the mother's pain


Of travailing in vain!



And jealousy, ah me!


How frightful 'tis to see,


134


When each the other taunts,


Where stolen friendship haunts!



What wormwood and what gall,


Worst recompence of all,


To rear up family,


And then dishonoured be!



One care is thine, one call,


To look to God in all!


But little thou dost need:


That little God will speed.



Shelter and barley cake


Sufficient wealth will make:


Nor shall dire need impart


Keen edge to tempter's dart,


As when Christ, hard bestead,


He bade turn stones to bread.



By thee, however tried,


Be all base gain denied:


Fowls of the air God feeds,


Sure then His saints He heeds.



135


Of oil, if faith prevail,


Thy cruse shall never fail.


By Cherith's desert brook


At the great Prophet look!


To feed him ravens sped:


So too shalt thou be fed!



How Thecla from the flame,


And lions, unscathed came,


Thou know'st: and how great Paul,


Preacher of truth to all,


Bore hunger, thirst, and cold,


Through death's worst forms still bold;


That thou might'st look, O maid,


To God alone for aid,


Who in the wilderness


With food can myriads bless.



Lo! beauty fadeth fast,


Nor will earth's glories last:


Wealth is a failing stream,


And power an empty dream.



But thou, faith's sail unfurled,


Hast fled this erring world,


Steering thy course on high


To realms beyond the sky.


There in the holy shrine


Thou shalt for ever shine:


And there with angels raise


The song of endless praise!



A better portion far


Than sons and daughters are!



But maidens, be ye wise,


And watch with longing eyes,


That when Christ shall return


Your lamps may brightly burn:


That with the Bridegroom ye


May enter in, and see


The beauty and the grace


Of His own dwelling place,


And share in truth and love


The mysteries above.

In course, and speak Thy wisdom all divine.


Thy light they are, the heavenly minds that be,


All sing on high the glorious Trinity.

Immortal, fleshless, glory's highest ray,


Who mortal flesh yet took'st, man's woes to stay,


For Thee I live, for Thee my songs arise,


For Thee I am a breathing sacrifice;


For this, of all things once possessed by me,


Alone remains, and this I give to Thee.



I tie my tongue, and loose it at Thy will;


In either, what Thou wouldst may I fulfil,


Speak what is right, nor think aught else beside:


From mire select the pearl, with Thee my Guide;


Gold from the sand, the rose from thorny brake,


From straw-encumbered ears the pure grain take.



To Thee, O Christ, this wreath of uttered praise,


As firstfruits of my loving toil, I raise.



For from the dead, with whom He mingled lay,


Great Christ arose, upon this gladsome day;


Gates of grim Hades He did open fling;


And broke death's power, and robbed him of his sting;


Rushed from the tomb, appeared to speaking men,


For whom, once born, He died and rose again;


That we new-born might rise, from death set free,


And ever live, ascending Lord, with Thee.


This day glad Heaven with acclamation rings,


And choir angelic crowning anthem sings.


This day my clos&#232;d lips I loose in song


To Thee, to whom my lute and breath belong.



Of mind to Mind, of word to the true Word,


I here have offered what I could afford:


Hereafter, if He will, I hope to bring


To the Great Spirit worthier offering.

What wouldst have done for thee?

Granted thy wish shall be.

Of all bright things, prized highest,


Beneath the rolling sun,

Of Gyges, Lydia's king,


To hide or show at pleasure


By power of magic ring?

Wouldst thou rich Midas follow?

Wouldst shine in brilliant trammels,


With pearls and jewels grand?


Have flocks, and herds, and camels,


And acres of fat land?

Such things we will not barter:


To thee they were a snare:


They are not in our charter,

For since to God advancing


I came at His own call,

Justice and truth o'erthrowing,


Pillage, and pillaged be?



14.


Wouldst take a martial bearing,


And sport with blood and gore?


Or, Pythian garlands wearing,


Defy the lion's roar?

Wouldst have the town applauding,


And statues reared to thee?


The world thy merits lauding,


Wouldst thou its idol be?



16.


Vain wish! a shadowy dreaming,


A moan of wind hence bound,


Whiz of an arrow gleaming,


A hand-clap's dying sound.



17.


Such things will fade to-morrow,


However bright to-day:


And he must sleep in sorrow


Who makes them his heart's stay.

To none is it then given


To carry aught below.



19.


What then, O soul repining,


Since these things nothing be,


Substantial good defining,


Wouldst thou have done for thee?



20.


Wouldst be a god, presiding


At God's own side most high,


Angelic chorus guiding,


All radiant o'er the sky?



21.


Go thou, on pinions gliding


Of vehement desire,


On rapid whirlwind riding


Whither thou dost aspire.



22.


To plume thy wing I'm trying,


Nor spare the friendly goad:


Mount upward, bird-like flying


On thine ethereal road.



23.


But earth's own child on crutches,


Since, I am yoked to thee,


As queen in butchers' clutches,


Just tell how this must be;



24.


Whom wilt thou have abettor,


To be upheld in breath?


For I'm no more thy debtor,


Nor heed vain threats of death.



25.


Or wouldst thou perfumed table,


With dainties covered o'er,


So art cuisine be able


To stimulate thee more?



26.


And lyre, and whirl so maddening


Of rapid foot and hand,


And things to tell too saddening,


Known to the revelling band?



27.


Art thou for such things wrangling?


Have thy desire!--but wait:


Such things, not life, but strangling,


To friends insatiate!



28.


For thee, a house abideth,


A rock with self-formed dome;


Nature herself provideth:


We give thee such a home!



29.


Or if thy fancy leadeth


To build thyself a cell,


But little toil it needeth,


Where thou mayst safely dwell,



30.


The body claims small payment,


Ere it returns to dust:


Skins, camel's hair, for raiment


Sufficed of old the just.



31.


And grass, or straw, as chances,


Make thou thy humble bed:


And purple heath, or branches,


Thy coverlet be spread.



32.


Such for my guests is meetest:


No fear to great or small:


Plain table: odours sweetest,


Kind earth's free gifts to all.



33.


Thus housed, we will thee nourish,


As best we can afford:


Wouldst eat? take bread and flourish:


Take meal, if on the board.



34.


Here's salt: and thyme we scant not:


Such source no toil requires:


More luxuries we want not,


Whate'er the world desires.



35.


Or drink wouldst thou? there springeth


An everflowing bowl:


No bane the fountain bringeth,


Bright cheerer of the soul.



36.


But wouldst unbend in season,


And not, o'erstrained, repine?


We grant in this is reason,


Nor grudge the rough-made wine.



37.


But thou dost spurn all measure,


And wouldst the vessel bore,


And take huge draughts of pleasure


Till thou couldst hold no more.



38.


Then seek another helot,


All lengths with thee to go,


No idler I, nor zealot,


To nurse domestic foe.



39.


116


A frozen reptile taken,


And with fond warmth caressed:


See! it to life doth waken,


And wound me in the breast.



40.


Wouldst boundless gold-roofed mansions,


Gemmed paragons of art,


And master-piece expansions,


To life which almost start?



41.


Colours with colours blending


In opposite array;


Rare tablets, softness lending,


Or shining bright as day?



42.


Dost long for robes wide-flowing,


Pride of the untouched great;


And wealth on fingers glowing,


Incredible to state?



43.


117


Art thou at beauty aiming?


The wise would scorn to win:


More I than all, proclaiming


That beauty is within.



44.


Thus I to men benighted,


of earth the creatures fond,


For time alone quick-sighted,


With not a thought beyond.



45.


But ye who soar up higher,


A noble life to live;


Who would to heaven be nigher,


Behold what God doth give!



46.


In poorest clay there dwelleth


That which can never die:


With this my bosom swelleth:


For this I food supply!



47.


God-minded, thyself harden!


Meet calm the flashing sword!


Plant trees for God's own garden!


Be worker, with the Lord!



48.


Up! living words be building,


In God's blest truth secure.


Not robbed by foe's false gilding


Through pleasure's baneful lure!



49.


Again of life eternal,


Approach the bless&#232;d tree


The way, O Thou Supernal,


I've found in knowing Thee.



50.


Past, present, never-ending,


The One great Light in Three;


To whom all things are tending:


To Thee, all glory be!



EPILOGUE.51.


To self the wise thus speaketh,


Turning his eyes within;


And eager there he seeketh


To find out lurking sin.



52.


But who to speak refuseth,


Will pass his days in vain:


Nay, more! the ease he chooseth,


May end in greatest pain.

May Thy comfort render sweet


Ev'ry bitter cup I meet;


Thou who by Thy death and Passion


Hast procured my soul's salvation.



5 Lord, on Thee alone I stay me,


Safely hid beneath Thy wing;


Death can neither hurt nor slay me,

That I may in Thee have part,


Comfort, strengthen, heal my heart;


Light, and life, and love bestowing,


All from Thy free mercy flowing.



6 Well of life, if Thou art near me,


Springing deep within my heart,


When the last dread hour shall try me,


I can feel no inward smart:


If I hide myself in Thee,


Not a foe can injure me;


He shall overcome who hideth


In Thy wounds, and there abideth."

I may a host defy;


For when I pray, before me


My foes confounded fly.


If Christ, the Head, befriend me


If God be my support


The mischief they intend me


Shall quickly come to naught.



2 This I believe, yea, rather,


In this I make my boast,


That God is my dear Father,


The Friend who loves me most;


And that, whate'er betide me,


My Savior is at hand


Through stormy seas to guide me


And bring me safe to land.



3 I build on this foundation:


That Jesus and His blood


Alone are my salvation,


The true, eternal good.


Without Him all that pleases


Is valueless on earth;


The gifts I owe to Jesus


Alone my love are worth.



4 My Jesus is my Splendor,


My soul's bright beaming Sun;


Were He not my Defender


Before God's awful throne,


I never should find favor


And mercy in His sight,


But be destroyed forever


As darkness by the light.



5 He canceled my offenses,


And saved my soul from death;


'Tis He who ever cleanses


Me from my sins through faith.


In Him I can be cheerful,


Bold, and undaunted aye.


In Him I am not fearful


Of God's great Judgment Day.



6 Naught, naught, can e'er condemn me,


Nor set my hope aside;


Now hell no more can claim me,


Its fury I deride.


No sentence e'er reproves me,


No ill destroys my peace,


For Christ, my Savior, loves me


And shields me with His grace.



7 His Holy Spirit dwelleth


Within my willing heart,


Tames it when it rebelleth


And soothes the keenest smart.


He crowns His work with blessing,


And helpeth me to cry,


'My Father!' without ceasing,


To Him who dwells on high.



8 And when my soul is lying


Weak, trembling, and opprest,


He pleads with groans and sighing


That cannot be expressed;


But God's quick eye discerns them,


Although they give no sound,


And into language turns them


E'en in the heart's deep ground.



9 To mine His Spirit speaketh


Sweet word of holy cheer,


How God, to him that seeketh


For rest, is always near,


And how He hath erected


A city fair and new,


Where what our faith expected


We evermore shall view.



10 In yonder home doth flourish


My heritage, my lot;


Though here I die and perish,


My heav'n shall fail me not.


Though care my life oft saddens


And causeth tears to flow,


The light of Jesus gladdens


And sweetens ev'ry woe.



11 Who clings with resolution


To Him whom Satan hates


Must look for persecution


Which never here abates;


Reproaches, griefs and losses


Rain fast upon his head,


A thousand plagues and crosses


Become his daily bread.



12 All this I am prepared for,


Yet am I not afraid;


By Thee shall all be cared for,


To whom my vows were paid.


Though life and limb it cost me,


And all the earthly store


Which once so much engrossed me,


I love Thee all the more.



13 Not fire, nor sword, not thunder,


Shall sever me from Thee;


Though earth be rent asunder,


Thou'rt mine eternally.


Not hunger, thirst, nor danger,


Not pain, or pinching want,


Nor mighty princes' anger


My fearless soul shall daunt.



14 No angel, and no gladness,


No throne, no pomp, nor show,


No love, no hate, no sadness,


No pain, no depth of woe,


No scheme of man's contrivance,


Though it be great or small,


Shall draw me from Thy guidance


Nor one of these, nor all!



15 My merry heart is springing,


And knows not how to pine;


'Tis full of joy and singing,


And radiancy divine, 


The Sun whose smiles so cheers me


Is Jesus Christ alone;


To have Him always near me


Is heav'n itself begun.

Our fathers built to God;

In heaven are kept their grateful vows,

Their dust endears the sod.

Here holy thoughts a light have shed

From many a radiant face,

And prayers of tender hope have spread

A perfume through the place.

And anxious hearts have pondered here

The mystery of life,

And prayed the Eternal Spirit clear

Their doubts and aid their strife.

From humble tenements around

Came up the pensive train,

And in the church a blessing found,

Which filled their homes again.

For faith, and peace, and mighty love,

That from the Godhead flow,

Showed them the life of heaven above

Springs from the life below.

They live with God, their homes are dust;

But here their children pray,

And, in this fleeting lifetime, trust

To find the narrow way.

On him who by the altar stands,

On him Thy blessing fall!

Speak through his lips Thy pure commands,

Thou Heart, that lovest all!

Press on, press on! through toil and woe,

With calm resolve, to triumph go,

And make each dark and threatening ill

Yield but a higher glory still.

Press on, press on! still look in faith

To him who vanquished sin and death;

Then shall ye hear God's word, &#8220;Well done!&#8221;

True to the last, press on, press on!

Look not here to find repose,

This is but thy battle-ground.

Up! and take thy shield and sword;

Up! it is the call of Heaven;

Shrink not faithless from thy Lord,

Nobly strive as he hath striven.

Break through all the force of ill;

Tread the might of passion down;

Struggle onward, upward still,

To the conquering Saviour's crown!

Keeps watch round our footsteps wherever we go;

His mercy is sleepless,&#8212;His wisdom unfailing,&#8212;

Where now is death's terror? he comes as an angel

To carry the spirit away to its rest;

The gloom which he weareth is lost in the message

He brings from the Being who loveth us best.

May we live ever true to the hopes He hath given,

While they shed o'er our path a still holier light;

Ever making us nearer and nearer to heaven,

More pure our affections, our spirits more bright.
