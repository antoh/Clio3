1 Jesus, these eyes have never seen


That radiant form of Thine;


The veil of sense hangs dark between


Thy blessed face and mine.



2 I see Thee not, I hear Thee not,


Yet art Thou oft with me;


And earth hath ne'er so dear a spot


As where I meet with Thee.



3 Like some bright dream that comes unsought,


When slumbers o'er me roll,


Thine image ever fills my thought,


And charms my ravished soul.



4 Yet though I have not seen, and still


Must rest in faith alone;


I love Thee, dearest Lord, and will,


Unseen, but not unknown.



5 When death these mortal eyes shall seal,


And still this throbbing heart,


The rending veil shall Thee reveal,


All glorious as Thou art.



Amen.
