1 To shepherds as they watched by night


Appeared a host of angels bright;


'Behold the tender Babe,' they said,


In yonder lowly manger laid.



2 'At Bethlehem, in David's town,


As Micah did of old make known;


Tis Jesus Christ, your Lord and King,


Who doth to all salvation bring.'



3  Oh, then rejoice that through His Son


God is with sinners now at one;


Made like yourselves of flesh and blood,


Your brother is th'eternal God.



4 What harm can sin and death then do?


The true God now abides with you.


Let hell and Satan rage and chafe,


Christ is your Brother--ye are safe.



5 Not one He will or can forsake


Who Him his confidence doth make.


Let all his wiles the Tempter try,


You may his utmost pow'rs defy.



6 Ye shall and must at last prevail;


God's own ye are, ye cannnot fail.


To God forever sing your praise


With joy and patience all your days.
