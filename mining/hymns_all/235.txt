In the Saviour's hour of death,

Bound upon the cross of fear,

While his quick and struggling breath

Spoke the fatal moment near,

While his proud, triumphant foes

Mocked the sufferings that he bore,

Then his loving spirit rose

More sublime than e'er before.

He has taught us to forgive,

By his words in days gone by;

He has taught us how to live;

Can he teach us how to die?

Listen! as the cross they raise,

One brief prayer ascends to heaven;

For his murderers he prays,&#8212;

Father, may they be forgiven!
