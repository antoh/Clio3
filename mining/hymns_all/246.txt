1 Arise, O Christian people!


Prepare yourselves today;


Prepare to greet the Savior,


Who takes you sins away.


To us by grace alone


The truth and light were given;


The promised Lord from heaven


To all the world is shown.



2 Prepare the way before Him;


Prepare for Him the best.


Cast out what would offend Him,


This great, this heav'nly guest.


Make straight, make plain the way:


The lowly valleys raising,


The heights of pride abasing,


His path, all even lay.



3 The humble heart and lowly


God raises up on high;


Beneath His feet in terror


The haughty soul shall lie.


The heart sincere and right,


That heeds God's invitation


And makes true preparation--


It is the Lord's delight.



4 Prepare my heart, Lord Jesus;


Turn not from me aside,


And help me to receive You


This blessed Advent-tide.


From stall and manger low


Come now to dwell within me;


I'll sing Your praises gladly


And forth Your glory show.
