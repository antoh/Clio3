In vain we thus recall to mind

The cross our Master bore,

Unless a holier strength we find,

And love his spirit more.

May we, like him, though thanked with ill;

Insulted, and withstood,

In hope and patience labor still

To do our brethren good.

Like him may we, unmurmuring, go

Our heaven-appointed way,

And learn, 'midst gathering storms of woe,

'God's will be done!' to say.
