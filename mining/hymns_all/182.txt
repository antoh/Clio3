1 We are called by one vocation,


Membes of one family,


Heirs through Christ of one salvation,


Let us live in harmony;


Nor by strife embitter life,


journeying to eternit.



2 In a land where all are strangers,


And our sojourning so short,


In the midst of common dangers


Concord is our best support;


Heart with heart divides the smart,


Lightens grief of ev'ry sort.



3 Let us shun all vain contention


Touching words and outward things,


Whence, alas! so much dissension


And such bitter rancor springs;


Troubles cease, where Christ brings peace


And sweet healing on His wings.



4 Judge not hastily of others,


But thine own salvation mind;


Nor be mindful of thy brother's, 


To thine own offenses blind;


God alone discerns thine own,


And the hearts of all mankind.



5 Let it be our chief endeavor


That we may the Lord obey,


Then shall envy cease forever


And all hate be done away;


Free from strife shall be his life


Who serves God both night and day!
