O, not to crush with abject fear

The burdened soul of man

Did Jesus on the earth appear,

And open heaven's high plan:

He came to bid him find repose,

And God his Father know;

And thus with love to raise up those

That once were bowed low.

O, not in coldness nor in pride

His holy path he trod;

'Twas his delight to turn aside

And win the lost to God;

And unto sorrowing guilt disclose

The fount whence peace should flow;

And thus with love to raise up those

That once were bowed low.

O, not with cold, unfeeling eye

Did he the suffering view;

Not on the other side pass by,

And deem their tears untrue;

'Twas joy to him to heal their woes,

And heaven's sweet refuge show;

And thus with love to raise up those

That once were bowed low.
