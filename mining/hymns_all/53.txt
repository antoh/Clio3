1 Hark! the sound of holy voices,


Chanting o'er the crystal sea,


Alleluia, Alleluia,


Alleluia, Lord, to Thee;


Multitude, which none can number,


Like the stars in glory stands,


Clothed in white apparel, holding


Palms of victory in their hands.



2 Patriarch, and holy Prophet.


Who prepared the way for Christ,


King, Apostle, Saint, Confessor,


Martyr and Evangelist;


Saintly Maiden, Golden Matron,


Widows who have watched to prayer,


Joined in holy concert, singing,


To the Lord of all, are there.



3 They have come from tribulation,


And have wash'd their robes in blood,


Wash'd them in the blood of Jesus;


Tried they were, and firm they stood;


Mock'd, imprison'd, stoned, tormented,


Sawn asunder, slain with sword,


They have conquer'd death and Satan


By the might of Christ the Lord.



4 Marching with Thy cross their banner,


They have triumph'd, following


Thee, the Captain of salvation,


Thee, their Saviour and their King;


Gladly, Lord, with Thee they suffer'd;


Gladly, Lord, with Thee they died;


And by death to life immortal


They were born and glorified.



5 Now they reign in heavenly glory,


Now they walk in golden light,


Now they drink, as from a river,


Holy bliss and infinite:


Love and peace they taste for ever,


And all truth and knowledge see


In the beatific vision


Of the bless'd Trinity.
