1 Beyond the smiling and the weeping 


I shall be soon;


Beyond the waking and the sleeping,


Beyond the sowing and the reaping,


I shall be soon.


Love, rest, and home! Sweet hope!


Lord, tarry not, but come.



2 Beyond the blooming and the fading


I shall be soon;


Beyond the shining and the shading,


Beyond the hoping and the dreading,


I shall be soon.


Love, rest, and home! Sweet hope!


Lord, tarry not, but come.



3 Beyond the rising and the setting


I shall be soon;


Beyond the calming and the fretting,


Beyond remembering and forgetting,


I shall be soon.


Love, rest, and home! Sweet hope!


Lord, tarry not, but come.



4 Beyond the parting and the meeting


I shall be soon;


Beyond the farewell and the greeting,


Beyond the pulse's fever-beating,


I shall be soon.


Love, rest, and home! Sweet hope!


Lord, tarry not, but come.



5 Beyond the frost-chain and the fever


I shall be soon;


Beyond the rock-waste and the river,


Beyond the ever and the never,


I shall be soon.


Love, rest, and home! Sweet hope!


Lord, tarry not, but come.



Amen.
