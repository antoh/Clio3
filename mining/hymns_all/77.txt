God the Lord is King: before him

Earth with all thy nations, wait!

Where the cherubim adore him,

Sitteth he in royal state:

He is holy; He is holy;

Blessed, only Potentate!

God the Lord is King of glory,

Zion, tell the world his fame;

Ancient Israel, the story

Of his faithfulness proclaim:

He is holy; He is holy;

Holy is his awful name.

Laws divine to them were spoken

From the pillar of the cloud;

Sacred precepts, quickly broken!

Fiercely then his vengeance flowed:

He is holy; He is holy;

To the dust their hearts were bowed.

But their Father God forgave them

When they sought his face once more:

Ever ready was to save them,

Tenderly did he restore:

He is holy; He is holy;

We too will his grace implore.
