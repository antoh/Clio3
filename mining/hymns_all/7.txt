The first Eternal Mind was law to all,


And did the Universe to being call:


Next, of the First-born forth was chaos spread


And thirdly, soul on task of labour sped:


But it in vesture thin, and slight array,


O'ercome with toil, to death becomes a prey.


At one time regnant it beholds the light;


Then soon laments, cast down in piteous plight.


'Tis hazard all: now joy, now grief, befalls;


And now it dies, and now fresh life recalls.


In never-ending labyrinth of woes


It, wretched, hither now, now hither goes.


Then Jesus spake: On earth, O Father, see


How things have strayed in dire perplexity


Far from Thy Breath: how floods of evil roll,


And in base matter overwhelm the soul!


Escape it seeks from bitter woe all round,


But knows not where a passage may be found.


O Father, Me upon this errand send:


Bearing Thy seals, I will the depths descend;


Throughout whole ages I will make my way,


All mysteries of darkness turn to day;


And godlike forms I thenceforth will display:


Forth Knowledge I will call to quell all strife,


And upward show the holy paths of life.
