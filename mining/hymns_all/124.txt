1. Yes, for me, for me He careth


With a brother's tender care;


Yes, with me, with me He shareth


Ev'ry burden, ev'ry fear.


Yes, o'er me, o'er me He watcheth,


Ceaseless watcheth, night and day;


Yes, e'en me, e'en me He snatcheth


From the perils of the way.



2. Yes, for me He standeth pleading


At the merecy-seat above;


Ever for me interceding,


Constant in untiring love.


Yes, in me, in me He dwelleth;


I in Him, and He in me!


And my empty soul He filleth,


Here and thro' eternity.
