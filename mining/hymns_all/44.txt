1. The advent of our God


With eager hearts we greet,


And singing, haste upon the road


His coming reign to meet.



2. For, lo, God's Word and Son


Came down to make us free,


And he a servant's form put on,


To bring us liberty.



3. Daughter of Zion, rise


To meet thy lowly king;


Let not thy heart in hast despise


The peace He comes to bring.



4. For judgment doth befall


The stubborn who refuse,


But God doth give His light to all


Who cherish His good news.



5. Then evil flee away


Before the rising dawn!


Let this old Adam day by day


God's image still put on.



6. Thou Liberator true,


All glory be to thee,


To whom in God our praise is due


For all eternity.
