1 Bathed in unfallen sunlight,


Itself a sunborn gem,


Fair gleams the glorious city,


The new Jerusalem!


City fairest, splendor rarest,


Let me gaze on thee!


O city fairest, splendor rarest,


Home for all the free! 



2 Calm in her queenly glory,


She sits all joy and light:


Pure in her bridal beauty,


Her raiment festal white!


Home of gladness, free from sadness,


Let me dwell in thee!


O home of gladness, free from sadness,


Mine eternally! 



3 Shading her golden pavement,


The tree of life is seen,


Its fruit-rich branches waving,


Celestial evergreen.


Tree of wonder, let me under


Thee forever rest!


O tree of wonder, let me under


Thy rich boughs be blest! 



4 Rich are the priceless jewels


That deck her mighty wall,


And from the throne of God-head


A wondrous radiance falls.


City fairest, splendor rarest,


Let me gaze on thee!


O city fairest, splendor rarest,


Home for all the free!
