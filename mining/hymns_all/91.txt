1.Always with us, always with us:


Words of cheer and words of love;


Thus the risen Savior whispers,


From His dwelling place above.


With us, when we toil in sadness,


Sowing much and reaping none;


Telling us that in the future


Golden harvests shall be won.



2. With us, when the storm is sweeping


O'er our pathway dark and drear;


Waking hope within our bosoms,


Stilling ev'ry anxious fear:


With us, in the lonely valley,


When we cross the chilling stream;


Lighting up the steps to glory,


With salvation's radiant beam.
