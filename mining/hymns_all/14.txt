Thee, with the holy self-sprung Fount, we sing,


Who art from all eternity great King,


God and of God, immortal, glorious One,


The, only Father's true and only Son!


To Thee, with Him, our praises all belong;


Thee will we crown with choicest flowers of song.


Son of the Father, Thou by birth Divine!


In Thee all bright the Father's glories shine.


And from the Father and through Thee, behold!


The spirit issues--mystery threefold!


And takes the middle place of light and mind,


In Trinity and Unity combined.



Poured was the sacred Fountain into Thee;


Yet One it was, and is eternally.


The Father's Wisdom, Mind, and beauteous Ray,


Eternal Son, Thou dost to all display.


Of hidden Deity the outstanding light,


In Thee the purposes Divine are bright;


For thus the Eternal Father did decree,


That Thou Beginning to all worlds shouldst be;


And bring to bodies shape and form combined


With powers, from highest source, of thought and mind.


The orb of heaven in wisdom Thou dost guide,


And shepherd o'er the flock of stars preside.


Thou leader art of angels' choir and band;


Thou dost the phalanx of God's hosts command.


And Thou too dost the mortal race befriend,


And all their paths and wandering steps attend.


The Spirit undivided Thou dost spread
