The earth, all light and loveliness,

In summer's golden hours,

Shines, in her bridal vesture clad,

And crowned with festal flowers,

So radiantly beautiful,

So like to heaven above,

We scarce can deem more fair that world

Of perfect bliss and love.

Is this a shadow faint and dim

Of that which is to come!

What shall the unveiled splendor be

Of our celestial home,

Where waves the glorious tree of life,

Where streams of bliss gush free,

And all is glowing in the light

Of immortality!
