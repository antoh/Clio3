1 O Christ, who art the Light and Day,


Thou drivest night and gloom away;


O Light of light, whose Word doth show


The light of heav'n to us below.



2 All-holy Lord, in humble prayer,


We ask tonight Thy watchful care.


O grant us calm repose in Thee,


A quiet night, from perils free.



3 Our sleep be pure from sinful stain;


Let not the Tempter vantage gain,


Or our unguarded flesh surprise


And make us guilty in Thine eyes.



4 Asleep though wearied eyes may be,


Still keep the heart awake to Thee;


Let Thy right hand outstretched above


Guard those who serve the Lord they love.



5 Behold, O God, our Shield, and quell


The crafts and subtleties of hell;


Direct Thy servants in all good,


Who Thou hast purchased with Thy blood.



6 O Lord, remember us who bear


The burden of the flesh we wear;


Thou who dost e'er our souls defend,


Be with us even to the end.



7 All praise to God the Father be,


All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,


Whom with the Spirit we adore


Forever and forevermore.
