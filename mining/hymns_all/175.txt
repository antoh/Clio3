Lord! what offering shall we bring,

At Thine altars when we bow?

Hearts, the pure, unsullied spring,

Whence the kind affections flow:

Willing hands, to lead the blind,

Heal the wounded, feed the poor;

Love, embracing all our kind,

Charity, with liberal store.

Teach us, O thou Heavenly King,

Thus to show our grateful mind,

Thus the accepted offering bring,

Love to Thee and all mankind.
