No more, on earth no more,


Shall beam for us that eye;


Closed in a strange forgetfulness


Forever it must lie.



No more, on earth no more,


Shall we behold that face;


Within the mournful halls of death


Must be its dwelling-place.



No more, on earth no more,


Shall those dear lips be heard;


Cold silence there hath fixed its seal,


Breathed is their latest word.



'Tis so fond Nature mourns


Affection's broken ties;


But Faith stands forth, she points on high,


Serenely she replies:



No more, in heaven no more,


That eye is dim with tears;


But bright, and brighter still, the scene


Before its view appears.



No more, in heaven no more,


That face a shadow bears;


But looks of light, born of a bliss


Unknown to earth, it wears.



No more, in heaven no more,


That voice is faint with pain;


It mingles with angelic bands,


In their enraptured strain.



No more, in heaven no more,


The parting grief is known;


But love has all eternity


To look through as its own.
