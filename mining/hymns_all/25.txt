O Thou, the Word of truth divine!

All light I have not been,

Nor kept the day as wholly Thine;

For Thou dark spots hast seen.

The day is down: night hath prevailed:

My Lord I have belied;

I vowed, and thought to do, but failed;

My steps did somewhere slide.

There came a darkness from below

Obscuring safety's way.

Thy light, O Christ, again bestow;

Turn darkness into day.
