Lord, while for all mankind we pray,


Of every clime and coast,


O hear us for our native land,


The land we love the most.



O guard our shores from every foe;


With peace our borders bless;


With prosperous times our cities crown,


Our fields with plenteousness.



Unite us in the sacred love


Of knowledge, truth, and thee,


And let our hills and valleys shout


The songs of liberty.



Here may religion, pure and mild,


Smile on our sabbath hours,


And piety and virtue bless


The home of us and ours.



Lord of the nations, thus to thee


Our country we commend;


Be thou her refuge and her trust,


Her everlasting Friend.



Amen.
