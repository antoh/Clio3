Thou art blessed, O Lord, who nourishest me from my youth,


Who givest food to all flesh.


Fill your hearts with joy and gladness,


That at all times having all sufficiency,


We may abound to every good work


In Christ Jesus our Lord:


With whom to Thee (be) glory, honour, and might,


For ever and ever. Amen.
