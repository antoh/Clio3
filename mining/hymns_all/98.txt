By the cross of Jesus standing,

Love our straitened souls expanding,

Taste we now the peace and grace!

Health from yonder tree is flowing,

Heavenly light is on it glowing,

From the blessed Suff'rer's face.

Here is pardon's pledge and token,

Guilt's strong chain for ever broken,

Righteous peace securely made;

Brightens now the brow once shaded,

Freshens now the face once faded,

Peace with God now makes us glad.

All the love of God is yonder,

Love above all thought and wonder,

Perfect love that casts out fear!

Strength, like dew, is here distilling,

Glorious life our souls is filling,

Life eternal, only here!

Here the living water welleth;

Here the Rock, now smitten, telleth

Of salvation freely giv'n:

This the fount of love and pity,

This the pathway to the city,

This the very gate of heav'n.
