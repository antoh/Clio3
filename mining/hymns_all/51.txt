1 Arm these Thy soldiers, mighty Lord,


With shield of faith and Spirit's sword;


Forth to the battle may they go,


And boldly fight against the foe,


With banner of the Cross unfurl'd,


And by it overcome the world;


And so at last receive from Thee


The palm and crown of victory.



2 Come, ever-bless'd Spirit, come,


And make Thy servant's hearts Thy home;


May each a living temple be,


Hallow'd for ever, Lord, to Thee,


Enrich that temple's holy shrine


With seven-fold gifts of grace divine;


With wisdom, light, and knowledge bless,


Strength, counsel, fear, and godliness.
