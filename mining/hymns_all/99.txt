1 Calm me, my God, and keep me calm,


While these hot breezes blow;


Be like the night-dew's cooling balm


Upon earth's fevered brow.



2 Calm me, my God, and keep me calm,


Soft resting on Thy breast;


Soothe me with holy hymn and psalm,


And bid my spirit rest.



3 Calm me, my God, and keep me calm,


Let Thine outstretch'd wing


Be like the shade of Elim's palm


Beside her desert-spring.



4 Yes, keep me calm, though loud and rude


The sounds my ear that greet,


Calm in the closet's solitude,


Calm in the bustling street;



5 Calm in the hour of buoyant health,


Calm in the hour of pain;


Calm in my poverty or wealth,


Calm in my loss or gain;



6 Calm in the sufferance of wrong,


Like Him who bore my shame,


Calm 'mid the threatening, taunting throng,


Who hate Thy holy Name;



7 Calm as the ray of sun or star


Which storms assail in vain;


Moving unruffled through earth's war,


The eternal calm to gain.



Amen.
