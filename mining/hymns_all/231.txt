Burden of shame and woe!

How does the heart o'erflow

At thought of him the bitter cross who bore!

But we have each our own,

To others oft unknown,

Which we must bear till life shall be no more.

And shall we fear to tread

The path where Jesus led,

The pure and holy one, for man who died?

Or shall we shrink from shame,

Endured for Jesus' name,

Our glorious Lord, once spurned and crucified?

Then, 'mid the woes that wait

On this our mortal state,

Patience shall cheer affliction, toil, and loss,

And though the tempter's art

Assail the struggling heart,

Still, Saviour! in thy name we bear the cross.
