1 When to the sacred font we came,


did not the rite proclaim,


that, washed from sin, and all its stains,


new creatures we became?



3 With Christ the Lord we died to sin;


with him to life we rise,


to life which, now begun on earth,


is perfect in the skies.



3 Too long enthralled to Satan's sway,


we now are slaves no more;


for Christ hath vanquished death and sin,


our freedom to restore.
