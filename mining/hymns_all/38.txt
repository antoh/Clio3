Thou sore-oppress'd,


The Sabbath rest


In yon still grave art keeping!


All thy labour now is done,


Past is all Thy weeping!



The strife is o'er,


Nought hurts Thee more,


The heart at last hath slumber'd,


That in conflict sore for us


Bore our sins unnumber'd.



Thou awful tomb,


Once fill'd with gloom!


How blessed and how holy


Art thou now, since in the grave


Slept the Saviour lowly!



How calm and blest


The dead now rest


Who in the Lord departed!


All their works do follow them,


Yes, they sleep glad-hearted.



O lead us Thou


To rest e'en now,


With all who, sorely anguish'd


'Neath the burden of their sins,


Long in woe have languish'd.



O Blessed Rock!


Soon grant Thy flock


To see Thy Sabbath morning!


Strife and pain will all be past


When that day is dawning.
