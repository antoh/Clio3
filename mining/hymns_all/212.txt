1 My faith looks up to Thee,


Thou Lamb of Calvary,


Saviour divine!


Now hear me while I pray;


Take all my guilt away;


O let me from this day


Be wholly Thine.



2 May Thy rich grace impart


Strength to my fainting heart,


My zeal inspire;


As Thou hast died for me,


O may my love to Thee


Pure, warm, and changeless be,


A living fire.



3 While life's dark maze I tread,


And griefs around me spread,


Be Thou my Guide;


Bid darkness turn to day;


Wipe sorrow's tears away;


Nor let me ever stray


From Thee aside.



4 When ends life's transient dream,


When death's cold, sullen stream


Shall o'er me roll,


Blest Saviour, then, in love,


Fear and distrust remove;


Oh, bear me save above,


A ransom'd soul.
