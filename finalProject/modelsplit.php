      <h3>Dividing the Corpus by Gender of Author</h3>
      <p>As in the case of the frequent words, it is also informative to split the texts by the gender of the authors. Even more so than when looking at frequencies, there are significant differences in the themes identified. In general, the texts by female authors are much more earth focused, where the male authors are more apt to focus on abstract concepts.</p>
      <p>One caveat: I have reasons to question just how well the texts files survived Mallet's initial training commands. These results should be taken with a large dose of skepticism.</p>
