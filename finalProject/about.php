	<h4>Jeri Wieringa</h4>
				
	<p>I am a PhD student in history at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, studying the intersection of religious history, gender theory, and digital methodologies. My current research is focused on religious movements in the United States during the nineteenth-century, with a particular interest in Seventh-Day Adventism, millennialism, and the boundaries of “orthodox” religious belief and practice.</p> 
	<p>I received my Bachelor of Arts degree from Calvin College with majors in philosophy and English and graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> with a Master of Arts in Religion degree from Yale Divinity School, with a concentration in the History of Christianity.</p>
