<p>Hymns are a widely acknowledged source for the study of religious practice and are often seen, along with sermons, as way to trace changing religious beliefs. However, hymns are also a highly complicated source to work with, given that hymn texts appear in multiple variations across multiple denominations. In addition, hymns are participatory and performative, and so take on different meanings in each different performances.</p>
<p>This website is an exploratory project for examining the potential uses of existing hymn data for sustained study of hymns as a form of religious expression. While different sources are needed for more complete exploration of the performance of hymnody, the textual data does allow for the study in changing themes and language over time. In addition, the immensity of possible textual data when looking at variation in hymns across hymnals, denominations, and time makes hymn texts an idea case study for digital tools and methodologies.</p>
<p>Rather than make a series of webpages available for unstructured navigation, I am also using this website to experiment with digital storytelling. In this experiment, the pages are designed to be read linearly.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>The source for this experiment is the database of hymn information, <a href="http://www.hymnary.org">Hymnary.org</a>. This database is a relatively young project housed out of Calvin College in Grand Rapids, MI and is powered in significant part by volunteer effort to digitize hymnals. It is an example of a crowd sourced project that serves a community need and is also supported by a variety of institutions.</p>
<p>One benefit of using the Hymnary database is that the data is easily exportable. A CSV dump of the texts, tunes, hymnals, and people is available for download. In addition, the search results for particular hymn texts is available in JSON format. These two export features made the database a promising option as a datasource.</p>
<p>While the initial dump of the data was promising, the process of whittling down the data into a manageable size resulting in some problematic results. To reduce the data to a manageable size, I began by isolating the authors born between 1800 and 1809. This was an arbitrary data range. I wanted to get songs that were written during the middle of the century, and chose this range as those born at the beginning of the century would be in their mature years during the middle.</p>
<p>After isolating the songs that were documented as having been written by these authors and downloading the associated JSON files, I made a couple interesting discoveries. For one, many of the JSON files were empty. As a result, many of the authors identified at first had no transcribed hymns in the database. The original set of over a thousand hymns was reduced to a couple hundred with complete information.</p>
<p></p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These are the texts that survived the culling process. The table below is sortable by the different columns. In the end, 30 texts by women remained, in comparison to the nearly 240 texts by men. Rather than dealing at this point with the multiple versions of each hymn in various hymnals, I chose to keep only the oldest version available in the JSON file, in hopes of getting more historically accurate data.</p>

<p>The table can be sorted by each of the various columns. Clicking on "Details" will open up extended information about the hymn, including the publisher, the date of publication, and the full text.</p>
<p></p>
<p>------</p>
<p>One of the goals of this project was to text-mining could tease out some meaningful patterns in the language used by male and female hymn authors. Using R, I isolated out the frequent terms across the general corpus. I then ran a similar analysis after dividing the corpus based on the gender of the author. One initial pattern that emerges is that, while there is much similarity between the datasets, the female authors favored words like "home", "hope", "rest", and "sweet" while among the frequent words by male authors are "father", "king", "mind", "soul", "spirit", and "world."</p>
<p>Another way to use the data on frequent words is to look at word usage over the various documents. The charts below are a graphical depiction of the Document Term Matrix. These graphs show which of the frequent words appear in the documents of the corpus.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>Along with frequencies, word associations offer another interesting glimpse into the themes within the various texts. Here I have taken a couple of frequent words to plot the words associated with them. One common interpretation of gendered language is that "earth" and materiality is often associated with women and carries a negative connotation. However, in analyzing the texts written by women, positive words such as "precious" and "thrills" occur along side of negative words such as "temptations" and "snares." </p>
<p></p>
<p>The words associated with "children" point to it being used to describe not biological children, but the hymn-writer and singer's relationship as child of the divine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the female authors in this sample do not speak directly about "women" or "men", the male authors do offer so telling associations when speaking of women. However, I am hesitant to conclude too much from this data, as the string of associations at '1' makes me think that "female" only occurs in a few, if not one, text. In addition, the words associated with "male" are the same, which indicates that the same document or documents are being looked at.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The dendrogram offers another way of comparing word associations across the texts as words more likely to appear together or documents that are similar to each other are both grouped together and are placed on a similar horizontal plane. The dendrogram can be generated for document term matrices and term document matrices. As you can see below, the term document matrix is far more informative when dealing with a large number of texts. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Again, we see similar patterns with some interesting differences between the words and pairing between the male and female authors. Of particular note is that "earth" and "joy" are strongly associated across the texts by female authors where "earth" is associated with "father" and "soul" in the texts by male authors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, the document term matrix can be useful when dealing with a more restricted set of texts. Using this data we can begin to identify similarities between authors that may point to areas for further research.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Topic Modeling offers another window into patterns across the corpus. Using Mallet, we can generate a series of words that tend to occur together across the corpus. One point to consider is that the greater the number of topics, the more refined each individual topic. As you can see below, the two different sets of topics are generally similar, but with some significant differences. I need to look more closely to determine which is more useful for analyzing the corpus.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>As in the case of the frequent words, it is also informative to split the texts by the gender of the authors. Even more so than in analysis of frequencies, there are significant differences in the themes identified. In general, the texts by female authors are much more earth focused, where the male authors are more apt to focus on more abstract concepts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One caveat: I have reasons to question just how well the texts files survived the initial training commands. These results should be taken with a large dose of skepticism.  </p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>-------</p>
<p>In addition to looking at patterns in the textual data, mapping the location of the various publishers offers a way to see the hymns differently. In this map, all the publishers with location information have been noted. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Despite the possibilities that mapping holds, this map in particular reveals very little of interest. Because of the wide variety within the JSON files as to the earliest publication date, the publishers marked here include both 19th-century publishers and publishers from the late t century.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>In contrast, focusing on the publication history of a particular text over time is a more promising line of inquiry. In the map below, the publication history of one hymn, "My Country 'Tis of Thee," is traced over time. The tracing of hymns within across traditions and over time offers a window into how the text spreads and which traditions pick up the text at which times. Sales data for the publishers would further expand the picture of where different religious texts were popular at what times.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p></p>
<p>A few general conclusions to draw from the study. First, the Hymnary database, while incredibly useful, is problematic for historically focused investigations. In part because of the reliance on volunteers, the hymnals that are transcribed tend to reflect the preferences of those volunteers, and as such are more recent and, in this particular case, tend to reflect more traditional, if not Reformed, denominations. In addition, the hymn writers that are favored tend to be the more well-known male authors, a fact that limits the applicability of the archive for the study of lesser-known and untraditional female authors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That being said, analysis of the data that does exists points to the usefulness of these tools for studying patterns in religious language and dissemination of religious texts. With a larger set of texts, these tools can reveal different emphasis in religious language between men and women in different traditions. Such a large, distance level, reading was not possible with older methods of studying the most popular and widely disseminated texts. By reading across the texts for patterns and trends, we can start to see how gender is being negotiated in the religious language of the hymns and how those constructions are linked to concepts of salvation and fulfillment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additional data is needed for mapping of hymn texts to be useful in a meaningful way. But I am still hopeful that the tracking of publication data will offer new ways to visualize the spread of religious movements and metanarratives across space and time. As such, mapping remains an open question of investigation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In conclusion, while digital data for studying questions of gender and religious language in the nineteenth century is still relatively incomplete, the methods are promising. This should provide additional motivation for the creation of the digitized data that would make a more full scale analysis of these and other questions of language and the spread of ideas possible. These two, data creation and analysis go hand in hand, and to do the later, the groundwork of digital material must be laid. </p>
